          <seg id="2">"People Swimming in the Swimming Pool" from 2022 is one Vicente Siso artwork that will display at Tierra del Sol Gallery beginning Jan. 13. (photo courtesy of Vicente Siso)</seg>
          <seg id="3">Tierra del Sol is pleased to present "Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water" at the new gallery location in West Hollywood. Siso has been an artist in the Studio Arts Program since 2012, this marks his debut solo exhibition. Siso was born 1962 in Madrid and raised between Venezuela, Trinidad and Miami; he moved with his family to Southern California in his early 20s.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Masterfully working across subject matter, Siso has generated a prolific series of landscapes, portraits, and still-life works rendered in either acrylic, pastel, pencil or watercolor. Drawing from family portraits, his own reference photographs, and recollection, his colorful compositions demonstrate his range of interests and skill across media. Siso's tropical landscapes and seascapes reflect the geographies of his past, employing rich patterns and incorporating people to make meaningful connections between culture, memory and the environment. Siso titles his artworks in a mix of Spanish and English, signifying the celebrated and integral complexities of his life in Los Angeles County. "Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water" opens on Saturday, Jan. 13, with a reception from 6-8 p.m. The exhibition is on view through Sunday, March 3.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Adapt the old, accommodate the new to solve issue</seg>
          <seg id="2">At the precinct level, we just need to look at the Sydney CBD as an example of an area which has grown from its pre-settlement landscape into a two-storey city, from a maximum height of 150 feet to the soaring towers of today. At a much scaled-down level, the same can occur across Sydney's town centres located around transport nodes. Inner suburbs must also evolve, with a swing to more affordable apartment living at heights below the tree tops on key sites. Of course, the new growth in housing needs to be well-designed and trees, landscaping and parks need to be included along with other essential infrastructure.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Our planning system also needs to adapt so that planners in suburban councils, who seem to be less supportive of change, are not the only determinants of the future shape of their suburbs. A way forward could be to have an independent decision-making body that championed quality design as long as it fitted below the tree tops and incorporated family living, large balconies, common gardens and presented a friendly appearance. This could be a role for the current NSW government architect working within a carefully crafted complying code.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Over the past decade, our lives have changed through technology, with many working from home, and Sydney has gained an impressive network of metro and light rail systems. Our ability to purchase online has changed the way we shop, and friends and family seem closer because of smartphone communication. All of these adaptations from one system to another can also occur in our built environment through a planning focus on adaptive reuse rather than preferencing heritage preservation.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Chris Johnson is a former NSW government architect (1995-2005) and executive director, NSW Department of Planning (2005-2009). He was CEO of Urban Taskforce Australia between 2011 and 2019.</seg>

          <seg id="1">A final push for female equality</seg>
          <seg id="2">Last year, the World Economic Forum forecast that it would take five generations to achieve gender equality in every nation. Now the World Bank wants to rapidly accelerate that time frame.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The international financial institution is poised to launch a strategy aimed at significantly advancing the rights and economic opportunities for girls and women by 2030. The plan focuses on improving inclusivity and resilience through access to finance, technological innovation, and changes in public policy and law.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"Recent research demonstrates that both social norms and mindsets can change, for example, that engaging men and boys can foster their support and buy-in for gender equality," a consultative draft of the plan states. "Positive gender outcomes can be accelerated and scaled with a better understanding of ... how social norms and mindsets shape everyday expectations, priorities, and practices."</seg>
          <seg id="5">Shifts in thought are harder to quantify than bank loans for rural women or school enrollment for girls. Yet there is plenty of evidence that female agency can move mountains. In Iran, for example, women have led the greatest threat to the Islamic government in 40 years simply by refusing to comply with laws that force them to cover their hair. In some of the 130 countries with minimum quotas for female representation in government, such as India, male resistance to female voting and political activism has eased.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In some rural African communities, civil society organizations are replacing a harmful rite of passage with health education. One such program helped Kamanda Timayio, leader of the Masai village of Maparasha, Kenya, change his mind about female genital mutilation. He told Le Monde that he had "emerged from ignorance" and would abandon the practice.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The World Bank cites other examples. From 1970 to 2022, Bangladesh quadrupled female literacy rates and doubled female participation in the labor force. Its gross domestic product more than tripled. The change gathered its own momentum. Recruiting salaried women as teachers and health workers from within their own communities boosted trust "and made women's mobility and work more socially acceptable."</seg>
          <seg id="8">The bank's plan would target norms and institutions that may still require generational shifts. It has taken Rwanda more than two decades to establish itself as a model for land reforms that boost economic empowerment for women."No one benefits if women are held back," Rwanda President Paul Kagame said, arguing for land reform in 2015. "We have to change mindsets, not just the laws."</seg>
          <seg id="9">The World Bank hopes to spread that message.</seg>

          <seg id="1">German farmers and train drivers are scaring Germany's bosses</seg>
          <seg id="2">In Germany, where workers and bosses run many companies jointly, a big strike is unusual. A wave of big strikes is almost unheard of. Right now the country of "co-determination" is simultaneously facing an eight-day "action week" by irate farmers, who blocked roads with tractors, a three-day strike of railway workers and, to top it off, a looming strike of doctors, who already closed surgeries between Christmas and New Year's Day. This Mistgabelmop (pitchfork mob), as some have taken to calling it, will test Germany's harmonious labour relations in the year to come.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The protests were ostensibly set off by the government's decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. These measures pushed farmers over the edge. It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government's self-imposed austerity. On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In an effort to defuse the tension with the farmers, the government agreed to a gradual removal of the diesel subsidy over three years and to keeping the exemption from the car tax. The farmers pooh-poohed the concessions as insufficient. On January 4th an aggressive group of them prevented Robert Habeck, the economy minister, from disembarking from a ferry on his return from a family holiday. If the train drivers are similarly unimpressed, that could prove expensive for German business, reckons IW Köln, a think-tank. The rail strike could cost businesses €100m ($110m) a day if it forced them to interrupt production. The car, chemical and steel industries, Germany's biggest, are especially reliant on rail transport.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The workers" mood is increasingly angry. "Appeals are circulating with fantasies of revolution," warned Mr Habeck. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is doing its best to fan the grievances. In Dresden the Free Saxons, another far-right group, infiltrated the farmers" protest calling for the "extinction of the traffic light" (as the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, Free Democrats and Greens is referred to because of their party colours).</seg>
          <seg id="6">Thomas Puls of IW Köln fears that the strikes will harm the image of Germany as a place for business. Local bosses are already fretting about a German version of the gilets jaunes protests in France in 2018, which culminated in yellow-jacketed demonstrators torching cars on the Champs-Elysées and the police stepping in with tear gas. Jochen Kopelke, head of Germany's police union, warned in an interview with Tagesspiegel, a daily, that the farmers were probably "just the start of an enormous wave of protest this year." Germany was the only big economy to shrink in 2023, and the year ended on an especially sour note, with an unexpected drop in business confidence in December. This year is shaping up to be even tougher.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Brewers froth over winemakers" exemption from anti-waste rules</seg>
          <seg id="2">As the EU debates rules to limit packaging waste, beer producers argue they are being unfairly discriminated against with exemptions for winemakers from reuse targets and deposit-return schemes, but one of Europe's wine industry association chiefs says brewers should "mind their own business."</seg>
          <seg id="3">European brewers have warned that exempting wine and not beer from deposit return schemes and reuse targets is unfair and potentially illegal, as lawmakers enter final talks over a new law designed to turn a surging tide of packaging waste across the EU.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Environment ministers agreed an EU Council negotiating mandate on the proposed Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) before Christmas, paving the way for imminent political talks with the European Parliament, which are already underway at the technical level.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Our position is clear," the trade association Brewers of Europe wrote to MEPs and government negotiators (10 January). "If targets and mandatory requirements in the PPWR apply to beer then there is a legal obligation that they apply to all alcoholic beverage categories."</seg>
          <seg id="6">The 18 December ministerial summit yielded a carve out for winemakers from the requirement that, by the end of the decade, 10% of products must be supplied in reusable containers within a system for reuse or refill, rising to 40% in 2040. The exemption would also apply to the requirement, likewise supported by the European Parliament, that wine should be exempt from deposit-return schemes that should be put in place by 2029 under the proposal.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Both the Czech and Belgian ministers immediately expressed reservations at the 18 December summit about the unequal treatment for brewers, but acquiesced. Belgium, which now chairs the rotating EU Council presidency and is therefore in principle neutral in terms of inter-governmental negotiations, hopes to clinch a deal with the parliament by early March.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Ignacio Sánchez Recarte, secretary general of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins trade association representing some 7,000 wine producers across Europe, is dismissive of the concerns of the beer makers. He told Euronews that a market dominated by multinational brewing conglomerates bears no comparison with one comprised almost entirely of small, domestic producers.</seg>
          <seg id="9">More than 99% of the domestic wine sector is made up of micro- to medium-sized companies, Sánchez Recarte said, questioning the solidity of legal arguments made by brewers and asserting that his organisation had focused on presenting policy makers with information "relevant and appropriate" to its own industry.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"It is not my role to estimate if the beer sector should have this or that target, as it would depend on the intrinsic characteristics of their own sector," Sánchez Recarte said. "In the same way, brewers should mind their own business and focus on their own responsibilities."</seg>
          <seg id="11">Brewers of Europe shared with Euronews a brief legal analysis it sent to the European Commission last year, where it argues that wine and beer are competing products that are "at least partially, substitutable with each other," and which argued that rules favouring one over the other would distort the market.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Simon Spillane, the lobby group's head of operations, said brewers were "already leading the way" in packaging sustainability, citing the example of beer kegs being reused around 165 times before being crushed and recycled after 30 years. They support reuse recycling systems already in place in many countries, he said.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"We therefore advocate for an ambitious PPWR but need a level playing field in packaging legislation where beer and other alcoholic beverages play by the same rules, with each sector contributing fairly to reaching the targets and supporting collection systems," Spillane told. "Any other approach puts the brewers at a competitive disadvantage."</seg>

          <seg id="2">Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA enforcement attorney and the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, praised the Biden administration's recent improvements on enforcement while acknowledging the strong headwinds such efforts face. "It takes years of sustained funding and political support to build a good enforcement program," he told me. "The instability in Congress is not only demoralizing to EPA staff but undermines their ability to think strategically over the long term."</seg>
          <seg id="3">The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD. Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The Department of Justice's overall approach to corporate crimes has come under intense scrutiny from advocates. While watchdogs have lauded some steps the department has taken during Merrick Garland's tenure as attorney general - like finally establishing a database on corporate crime - Biden's DOJ has also leaned heavily on leniency agreements that allow companies to defer or avoid prosecution, and encouraged companies to scapegoat individual employees so as to avoid a broader charge. Kenneth Polite Jr., former assistant attorney general for DOJ's Criminal Division, revised the division's corporate enforcement policy so as to limit prosecutions.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Government Shutdown Debate Fuels House Republican Civil War</seg>
          <seg id="2">Conservative spending hawks in the House of Representatives bucked party leadership today - derailing a series of votes - in protest of Speaker Mike Johnson's recent spending deal with Democratic leadership that they feel does not go far enough in fiscal reductions.</seg>
          <seg id="3">While the Louisiana Republican can avoid confronting the issue for now, on January 19 the country will face its deadline to pass four of 12 annual spending bills. Johnson has publicly stated that he would not support a "continuing resolution" (CR) to extend the deadline on these four bills to the February 2 due date for the remaining eight.</seg>
          <seg id="4">However, with that deadline just 9 days away, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said Congress will need to pass a CR to keep things open, meaning the speaker may soon break a promise he made, largely to appease his right flank. Such a maneuver could ignite a heated ideological battle in a closely divided House over the GOP's role in spending cuts that may see the government face a partial shutdown or Johnson removed from his job.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"I've been very clear that CRs are not the way to fund our government that the Budget Act of 1974 calls for us to pass the 12 appropriation bills," Congressman Matt Rosendale of Montana told Newsweek. "We've had ample time to do that, and if the leadership does not direct the committees to get the work done and the members to be able to vote upon it, that therein lies the breakdown."</seg>
          <seg id="6">House Speaker Mike Johnson is pictured in the U.S. Capitol on December 12, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Johnson faces an unruly Republican conference that cannot reach an agreement on government spending levels. Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images</seg>
          <seg id="7">Rosendale, a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, was one of the individuals who derailed the Wednesday votes. He views the top line number in Johnson's deal as being too high and as doing too little to cut the $34 trillion national debt.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Rosendale was also among the 71 Republicans who opposed the Fiscal Responsibility Act struck between Democrats and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a deal that set the parameters for Johnson's recent negotiation with Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Johnson celebrated his deal for cutting an estimated $16 billion in spending, but the Freedom Caucus believes he could have gotten more. Moderate Republicans who backed McCarthy's deal see that stance as unrealistic and running counter to the Republican goal of forcing Congress to pass the 12 individual spending bills as opposed to the "omnibus" measure of recent years, which combined those 12 bills into one vote.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"New year, same idiotic behavior by some," New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler told Newsweek. "We're not doing an omnibus, so each bill is going to have to be dealt with at conference and negotiated. Obviously, the reality is we're probably gonna need more time to do that. And I don't support a government shutdown, so I have no problem with doing a short-term CR that allows for this process to be completed."</seg>
          <seg id="11">Congress has not passed all 12 bills individually since 1996. Lawler said it's worth delaying passage of four of the bills to ensure the process is done right. If Congress cannot pass the 12 bills by December, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a 1 percent budget cut would be applied to defense and non-defense discretionary spending.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky, one of the Republican Party's most vocal budget hawks but not among those who protested the Wednesday vote, said a yearlong CR that triggers the 1 percent spending cut may be the most feasible way to keep the government open while ending ongoing "brinkmanship."</seg>
          <seg id="13">However, he said the most "responsible way" to cut spending would be to pass all 12 bills. With many Republicans reticent to see a shutdown and a 1 percent cut to defense spending, the urgency to pass the bills could see enough Republicans ally with Democrats to extend the deadline on the four spending bills and reach an agreement to fund the government, even if doing so puts Johnson in hot water with some of those on the hard right.</seg>
          <seg id="14">"That [1 percent cut] is supposed to be motivation and leverage to get 12 separate bills done," Massie told Newsweek. "So, I think we could do a one-year CR, we can argue, and then we hit that tiny little bump in the road, then hopefully everybody's motivated to come to their senses. That's the way I would do it."</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Securities and Exchange Commission begrudgingly approved exchange-traded funds that directly hold bitcoin Wednesday, a move long-awaited by fans of digital currencies and criticized by financial watchdogs skeptical of the crypto industry.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The commission authorized 10 exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that invest in bitcoin, including funds proposed by giants such as Blackrock and Fidelity as well as by smaller financial companies.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin," SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. "Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."</seg>
          <seg id="5">Gensler also added that the approval of the bitcoin funds did not imply the SEC would approve funds or exchange-traded products (ETPs) based on other digital currencies or assets.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws," Gensler said.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The SEC rejected applications for similar funds for years. Last year, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled against the SEC's refusal to approve an application from Grayscale to convert a derivative fund into one that would directly bitcoin, calling the SEC's position "</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares," Gensler explained.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The much-anticipated approval has been hailed as a watershed event for digital currencies that proponents say will broaden access to investing in bitcoin and possibly lead to broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets. The price of bitcoin has exploded higher in recent months, rising from around $25,000 in September to more than $45,000, in part because many bitcoin investors believe the ETFs will create more demand for the asset.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Critics blasted the SEC on Wednesday night.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-founder, President, and CEO of Better Markets, said the approval is a "an historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability."</seg>
          <seg id="12">"With the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans," Kelleher said.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Authorities are urging the population to file reports in a bid to de-Russify the country</seg>
          <seg id="3">The number of complaints to authorities in Ukraine of a person speaking in Russian increased by 30% last year. Kiev actively encourages the population to report such cases in a bid to allegedly 'protect' the country from Russian influence.</seg>
          <seg id="4">According to the office of the commissioner for the protection of the state language, 3,692 language law violations were reported in 2023. Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa remain "leaders in terms of the number of complaints of violations. Therefore, strict controls over the observance of the language rights of citizens in all spheres of public life should be among the priorities of community leaders this year," Taras Kremen, the country's Language Ombudsman said.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Kremen also confirmed that a 3,400 hryvnia ($89) fine had been imposed on a Kiev taxi driver who serviced his clients in Russian. The ombudsman reminded the public of a "detailed algorithm of actions in case of violation of the right to receive information or services in the state language," urging people to immediately file complaints on the commissioner's website when such cases occur.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In 2019, Ukraine adopted a law that makes using the Ukrainian language obligatory in all spheres of public life, including government, medicine, science, education, and the media. Failure to comply can result in fines. Since 2022, when the military conflict with Russia began, Ukraine has undertaken a campaign of total de-Russification, with MPs saying it is necessary in order to defend against Russian influence. Local authorities have introduced complete bans on Russian-language works of art, performances, books, films, songs, and its study in schools and universities, and recommended that schoolchildren communicate in Ukrainian even during breaks.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Last August, a teenage signer was briefly detained and forced to record a video apology following a performance of Soviet singer Viktor Tsoy's songs on the street in the city of Lviv. The dismissal of several teachers who spoke Russian to their students also resulted in a public outcry.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Alexey Danilov, has previously said "the Russian language must disappear" from the territory of Ukraine "as an element of hostile propaganda and brainwashing of the population."</seg>
          <seg id="9">Moscow maintains that such laws violate the rights of Russian-speaking people, who make up around half of Ukraine's population. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in February that Kiev's "discriminatory campaign" against the language was growing more and more "indignant." In a survey conducted last September by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, respondents cited language discrimination as the most common type of prejudice in Ukraine, with 45% saying it was a problem.</seg>

          <seg id="2">As the latest tranche of NHS figures reveals more bad news, we should be outraged</seg>
          <seg id="3">An 83-hour wait in a hospital A&amp;E; four-in-ten patients waiting longer than four hours; 30 ambulances queuing outside a hospital, unable to respond to other emergency calls; staff "leaving shifts in tears" over the standard of care and "a near collapse of performance," according to an expert at the Royal College of Emergency Medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">If anyone dares to say that Scotland's NHS is not in a state of crisis or that these are just the usual winter problems, we should be outraged. The danger is that politicians like the embattled Health Secretary, Michael Matheson, will succeed in their efforts to convince us that, while regrettable, this is somehow acceptable, that there is nothing more that ministers can do in the circumstances, that this is the new normal.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Amid calls for his resignation over the abject failure of the SNP's NHS recovery plan, Matheson spoke of how the "heightened winter pressure" was "not unique to Scotland." Instead of "blame Westminster," the attempted defence this time was "Westminster's just as bad," as if that provided any comfort to the legions of patients forced to wait for hours on end in pain and distress.</seg>
          <seg id="6">He admitted that the age-old problem of delayed discharge - in which patients well enough to leave hospital cannot do so, often because the necessary social care is not available - was a "major factor," but claimed an action plan was being "implemented at pace." Given this has been a persistent issue for years, few will have high hopes the SNP has finally found a solution.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Indeed, new Public Health Scotland figures show the situation is actually getting worse: 1,910 people were delayed in hospital in November, up from 1,730 in April. One reason why ambulances cannot drop off patients promptly is that A&amp;E departments are full because wards are full.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Judging by the state of our hospitals, the SNP's talk of recovery plans and action plans is simply that - talk, and dangerous talk at that. We must not allow incompetent politicians to lull us into complicity in the demise of that great British institution, the National Health Service.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Move will also help transform land at the derelict Gartshore Works site.</seg>
          <seg id="3">A Scottish recycling business that has already processed more than a million tonnes of construction waste has opened a second plant following a multi-million pound investment.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Brewster Brothers" wash plants transform 100 per cent of the excavated soils and rubble they process from the construction industry into high-value aggregates for reuse. Over the past six years, the firm's site near Livingston, West Lothian has prevented almost 1.35 million tonnes of construction, demolition and excavation waste going to landfill. It has created more than one million tonnes of recycled aggregates to sell into the industry.</seg>
          <seg id="5">As part of a £6 million-plus expansion of the business, Brewster has now opened its second recycling site, regenerating the old Gartshore Works near Cumbernauld. The new plant will serve construction sites, housing and utilities developments in the western part of the Central Belt. The plant near Livingston, which currently employs 39 people, will continue to provide sustainable waste management services and recycled aggregates to businesses in Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Scott Brewster, managing director, who set up the business in 2017 alongside his father, Alex, said: "It's increasingly clear that the construction sector in Scotland appreciates the need to reduce the amount of natural resources that the industry uses and the amount of carbon it emits while increasing use of recycled and secondary materials. The volume of construction, demolition and excavation waste that's been recycled over the last six years has grown enormously, and our investment into this second site demonstrates that there's room for a further expansion in this area.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Scotland has big ambitions for transitioning to a circular economy, and the government plans to bring in a new devolved aggregates tax that should accelerate the shift away from the use of virgin products."</seg>
          <seg id="8">As part of the firm's redevelopment of the derelict Gartshore Works site it has recruited new members of staff supported by Scottish Enterprise's Green Jobs Fund. The firm will also recycle the old bing of colliery waste on the site, and the area will be turned into a country park for the local community.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Politicians get it wrong when it comes to rent caps</seg>
          <seg id="2">There is always the temptation for politicians to intervene in situations where they think they can make a difference. Of course, if there was an obvious simple solution to a problem somebody with more knowledge and understanding of the problems would already have implemented it.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Thus, we had the introduction of the Cost of Living (Tenant protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 nearly 18 months ago which sought to cap rents for a limited period to ease the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis. What we find now from the latest Scottish Government statistics is that, in the last year alone, average rents have increased in all sized properties, ranging from the lowest rise of 11.7 per cent for one-bedroom to the highest figure of 14.3 per cent for two-bedroom homes. Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.</seg>
          <seg id="4">There were plenty of warnings from all involved in the housing sector that this would happen, but these went unheeded. An unwillingness to believe that market forces are what dictates prices rather than government has led to enormous rent price rises which could have been avoided with greater understanding, negotiation and discussion with the sector and a plan that understood the principles of supply and demand.</seg>
          <seg id="5">With the Cost of Living Act legislation ending on 31 March 2024, a new consultation document seeks to extend controls on the level of rent increases that can be levied in the coming year. The consultation ends this Monday and proposes rents be set by the lowest of three comparators: open market rent; a landlord's proposed new rent; and a "reasonable" increase devised from a new taper system using comparison with a percentage of market rent.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Scottish tenants are likely to face further alarming rent increases if experts are not heeded (Picture: Adobe)</seg>
          <seg id="7">This tapering proposal would set rent increases between 6 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent which, ironically, would be higher than historic annual price rises. But, more importantly, this scheme would be unwieldy, overly complex and prohibitively expensive to monitor and implement. We already have a system involving the first-tier housing tribunal which rules on whether a rent increase is fair. This seems like adding further layers of bureaucracy with no gain for landlords or tenants.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved. Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis. Anything else is simply not going to work.</seg>

          <seg id="2">FTSE 250 firm famous for sausage rolls and steak bakes plans to rise branch network but not prices.</seg>
          <seg id="3">High-street bakery chain Greggs has said that in the year ahead it does not plan to hike prices, and is aiming to open 160 branches as it targets locations outside city centres.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Chief executive Roisin Currie told PA she has "no plans currently" to up prices at the till as it expects a more stable cost base over the year ahead. However, she added that it would be "a long time before we see deflation" that would allow the group to start reducing prices, with retailers among those facing higher wage bills due to increases in the national living wage - although she added that the trend of bigger pay packets is "good news as it puts more money into consumers" pockets."</seg>
          <seg id="5">Greggs has also revealed plans to debut up to another 160 stores in the year ahead, and cheered a strong end to 2023. The group opened a record 220 new shops over 2023, with 33 closures and 42 relocations, leaving it with 145 new sites on a net basis and taking its total estate to 2,473.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The FTSE 250 firm is to open between 140 and 160 outlets on a net basis in 2024 as it looks to give customers more convenient access to its stores. It will keep looking at expanding across retail parks, travel sites, and roadside locations, plus industrial estates. Currie said: "Where there's any location where you can't currently access a Greggs easily, we want to try and get into that location."</seg>
          <seg id="7">It also plans to continue rolling out evening opening hours on a targeted basis, with extended hours currently available in around 1,200 of its shops. The firm in a trading update posted a 9.4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales across its own-managed shops in the fourth quarter, a slowdown on the 14.2 per cent growth seen in the previous three months, as Greggs said there was less contribution from price inflation. It saw full-year comparable growth of 13.7 per cent, with total full-year sales up by a fifth to £1.8 billion.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The business also said it continued to see strong demand for vegan options, having recently brought back the vegan steak bake, as well as Christmas ranges, including its festive bake, chocolate orange muffin, and Christmas lunch baguette.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Greggs "can tick off 2023 as a year of real progress" on the back of extended opening hours, more delivery options, improving supply-chain capacity, and "a fresh new suite of tasty treats." He added: "Festive bakes and chocolate orange muffins lead the way over Christmas, but bears may point to sales growth slowing over the year, and the fourth quarter was the lowest of 2023. That's largely because Greggs was able to limit price hikes as inflation cooled. Longer-term, that's a net positive.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"One of Greggs' key strengths is offering a lower-value treat and keeping that proposition intact is key, especially when consumer incomes are stretched. The most important thing is to see volumes trend higher, and that remains the case. The job's not done. Expect to see more progress over 2024 as investment continues into the digital offering, delivery partnerships and expanding the store estate."</seg>

          <seg id="2">Politicians who think they can overturn judges" decisions are effectively putting themselves above the law</seg>
          <seg id="3">As has been pointed out for years by, among others, The Scotsman, the wrongful conviction of hundreds of Post Office branch managers in the Horizon scandal is one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in history. People were sent to prison, lost homes, marriages and reputations, and endured the mental torment of an honest person treated as a criminal.</seg>
          <seg id="4">While the root cause of their problems was the flawed Horizon computer system, Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake told MPs yesterday that the evidence showed "not only incompetence but malevolence" by the Post Office. He lamented that just 95 out of more than 900 convictions had been overturned. Now, a new law is to be introduced in England and Wales to exonerate the scandal's victims, with Downing Street saying it will work with the Scottish Government on similar steps.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It is extraordinary what can be achieved by a poignant television drama - ITV's Mr Bates Vs The Post Office - in an election year. After years of inaction, politicians are suddenly falling over themselves to do something. However, there are problems with Rishi Sunak's approach.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The first is that a blanket law clearing hundreds of people may inadvertently include some who were guilty but, given the pressing need to clear the innocent, this may be a price worth paying. The second is more serious. A law overturning court verdicts may set a dangerous precedent at a time when populists are testing the boundaries of political power.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In the US, Donald Trump is attempting to claim that, as president, he had immunity from prosecution. In the UK, Boris Johnson illegally suspended parliament to facilitate his Brexit plans, while Sunak wants to overturn a Supreme Court decision that Rwanda is not a safe country by passing a law to say that it is.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The concept of the separation of powers - the government, parliament and the judiciary - is a vital safeguard against tyranny. Politicians who think they can strike down judges" decisions are effectively putting themselves above the law. Voters must make clear this is not a position they will tolerate in anything other than the most extreme circumstances.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Bring back oversight for WA's jails. Lives depend on it</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Washington jail system is experiencing a fatality crisis. This is one of the uncomfortable but unavoidable truths we confronted as co-chairs of a legislative task force charged with studying our state's jail system and recommending changes to help make jails safer. Although we come from a variety of backgrounds, including jail administration, civil rights advocacy, and experience being incarcerated in jail, we all agree that there must be independent oversight of Washington's jails.</seg>
          <seg id="3">More than 130,000 people were booked into a Washington jail in 2022, and yet there is startlingly little information about what occurs once they get there. Washington has no statewide office responsible for monitoring jails and reporting data to the public. Some of the only information available relates to deaths in custody.</seg>
          <seg id="4">What we found demonstrates that immediate action is required. Even accounting for Washington's population growth, the Washington jail death rate nearly tripled between 2000 and 2019 - an increase 16 times that of the national average. Outpacing other states, Washington now has the fourth-highest rate of jail deaths in the nation. This cannot continue.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Reversing the trend of jail deaths, and solving the many other issues facing our jails, may require some difficult policy decisions. However, independent oversight of jails is a critical first step toward a safer and more humane jail system. Independent oversight is a demonstrated means of improving transparency and accountability both in Washington and across the country. By our count, at least 25 states have a statewide office responsible for overseeing jails, and all of them have a lower rate of jail deaths than Washington.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Closer to home, Washington has recently established or expanded independent oversight of state prisons, police, schools, and other entities. Jails are the notable exception to oversight of institutions that are responsible for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people.</seg>
          <seg id="7">An independent jail oversight office can monitor conditions in jails, meet with staff and incarcerated people, report on conditions that they have witnessed firsthand, and even communicate concerns before people are hurt. A jail oversight office can also collect and report data, helping administrators, policymakers, and the public understand our jail system and advocate for data-driven solutions to jail deaths and other problems relating to jails.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Oversight is not only for the benefit of incarcerated people. Our task force recognized that an oversight office can partner with overburdened jail systems to provide much-needed assistance and recommendations, including smart policies that promote staff safety and reduce recidivism.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Washington state briefly had a statewide jail oversight office from 1981-87, which the United States Department of Justice once trumpeted as a model for systems around the country. Unfortunately, the Legislature eliminated statewide jail oversight over the objections of jail administrators, civil rights groups, and others.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Independent oversight will promote public trust and data-driven decision-making in a field that has for too long operated without the benefit of transparency. We ask the Legislature to enact into law our task force's recommendation to restore independent oversight of our state's city, county, and regional jails. People's lives depend on it.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How to find out if you're flying on a Boeing 737 MAX</seg>
          <seg id="2">For most travelers, the aircraft model isn't a deciding factor when booking a flight. But with the majority of Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets grounded around the country after an Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout on Jan. 6, some prospective passengers may want to know how to tell what type of plane they'll be on and which models are the safest. The first is easy enough to answer - the second is a little more complicated.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The airplane model is typically noted in the booking information for a flight. On Google Flights, it's included in the flight details when a listing is expanded, and it's usually listed on individual airlines" reservation pages. If, for some reason, the plane type isn't apparent on Google Flights or the reservation page, sites like Expert Flyer and Seat Guru aggregate flight information like seat maps and aircraft type.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Determining which aircraft models are the safest is less straightforward. The National Transportation Safety Board maintains comprehensive databases of information about accidents and incidents. The Federal Aviation Administration also provides preliminary accident and incident reports, which include the manufacturer of the aircraft involved, from the past 10 days on its Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing page.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another useful resource the FAA links to is the Boeing Worldwide Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents 1959-2022, which assesses plane-type safety by breaking down accidents based on the aircraft model. According to the report, which was published in September 2023, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are the aircraft models with the fewest total hull losses, an accident in which the aircraft is destroyed beyond repair. There are a few additional models in the report that have never experienced a hull loss, including the double-decker behemoth Airbus A380. But those models had accumulated fewer than 1 million departures at the time of the report.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The report also includes a comparison of hull loss accident rates per million departures, which helps account for the fact that some of the models are more common or have been around longer than others. The Airbus A310, which was introduced in 1983, has the highest rate of hull losses - 2.53 per 1 million departures - among the models that are still in service as passenger aircraft. The Airbus 320 family, which includes the A321 and A319neo, has the lowest rate, at 0.11. The Boeing 737 MAX line, which has been around since 2017, has a rate of 1.48.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It's important to keep in mind that, even though these rates are per million departures, some of the plane models in this report - for example, the Boeing 727 introduced in 1964 - have been around for decades and consequently had much longer to accumulate an accident record than others.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Perry Cooper, a media representative from the Port of Seattle, which oversees Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, said in an email that there are a wide variety of reasons accidents occur, ranging from equipment to human error. So while it's easy enough to determine what type of plane you'll be on, it's more complicated to determine what that means from a safety perspective.</seg>
          <seg id="9">While you can make some comparisons of aircraft models based on the available data, the FAA advises against trying to compare airlines based on their accident records. According to a report cited by the administration, "there currently is no evidence in accident data that would support the ranking of individual airlines based on their safety records."</seg>
          <seg id="10">While there are often significant differences between airlines" safety records at any given point in time, this is largely due to the "infrequent but catastrophic nature of an air accident," according to the FAA, and these apparent differences between airlines even out over time. The FAA declined a request for comment.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How Betta Edu became a scapegoat of a dysfunctional political system</seg>
          <seg id="2">In a recent incident involving Betta Edu, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's administration, there have been calls for her removal from office amid allegations of misappropriation of a N585 million palliative fund. The minister has faced significant public backlash following the exposure of a leaked memo where she purportedly instructed Oluwatoyin Madein, the Accountant-General (AG) of the federation, to transfer N585 million to a private account.</seg>
          <seg id="3">As per the leaked memo dated 20 December 2023, Edu directed the Accountant-General to transfer the funds from the account of the National Social Investment Office to the private account of Bridget Oniyelu, the accountant of a Federal Government poverty intervention project called "Grants for Vulnerable Groups," a project under Mrs. Edu's ministry.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Speaking on behalf of Edu, Rasheed Zubair, her media aide, asserts that the act is legal within the framework of the Nigerian civil service. However, it is crucial to note that the request violates various sections of Nigeria's Financial Regulations 2009, which explicitly prohibit fraud and other forms of corruption in government business. Additionally, Chapter Seven, Section 713 of Nigeria's Financial Regulations 2009 explicitly states, "Personal money shall in no circumstances be paid into a government bank account, nor shall any public money be paid into a private account." It further stipulates, "Any officer who pays public money into a private account is deemed to have done so with fraudulent intention."</seg>
          <seg id="5">In an interview with Ventures Africa, an anonymous Senior Legal Official from a leading commercial bank commented, "There are several issues concerning this matter. First, her ministry is relatively new, and her predecessor and pioneering minister, Sadiya Umar-Farouk, engaged in activities that appeared to be illegal. It might be a reflection of how they operate in the ministry. Nevertheless, paying public money into private accounts goes against public procurement rules." He added that unless she can provide a valid reason for such approval, it may not necessarily involve fraudulent intent, but it is nonetheless incorrect, and certainty is lacking.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In a Twitter post, political and digital communications expert Akin Akinwale expressed the opinion that the ministry might not have been wrong to use a personal account.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Expressing a comparable sentiment on her Twitter account, Political Analyst and Development &amp; Management Consultant, Barrister Iyabo Awokoya, conveyed sympathy for the suspended minister. She believed that the minister might have made an innocent mistake driven by a zealous determination to accomplish her job.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Based on these expert arguments, it can be inferred that there exists a discord in financial laws between the federal government and other government parastatals. The situation escalated when the leaked document became public, with Betta Edu emerging as a scapegoat for a dysfunctional political system.</seg>

          <seg id="1">celeste is my favorite "tiny good freeware game to big bloated commercial game with stupidly detailed art" corruption arc because in the original getting the double dash is a contextless powerup in a treasure chest and in the commercial game it Makes Me Cry</seg>
          <seg id="2">In general I really like the interplay between the two games. The advantage of shortform stories is that you can "skip to the good part", they can be more immediately engrossing and satisfying. The advantage of longform stories is that you can imbue whatever happens with way more emotional weight, you lose the immediacy in exchange for stronger payoffs.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The climax of Celeste the commercial game is literally just the pico-8 game, blown up, with several hours of mechanical and narrative buildup letting it pop off way way harder. Celeste is so proud of its tiny parent game it throws in references like the memorial, the "2000 M... 2500 M..." progression, the power-up, the flag at the top. It lets you play the original game right from the title screen!</seg>
          <seg id="4">Celeste isn't "the good version" or "the finished version" of the pico-8 game, it's just a different approach to the same core story. As someone that loves both shortform and longform stuff, seeing the connection laid bare this way is really interesting and delightful.</seg>
          <seg id="5">There's another mid-scale version that could've existed between the two that tells the same expanded resonant story but with a tighter runtime and less insane production values. I think that would've been my favorite incarnation as like, an emotional arc... as is, the main single player arc of the commercial game is ultimately a small piece of it, it's most interested in being a big playground for the world's most loved-on platformer physics. which is still neat, I think.</seg>

          <seg id="1">I’ve only ever had one surgery where I needed general anesthesia. It was a “minor” neurosurgery giving my brain more room from a condition I was born with that became symptomatic after having kids (chiari malformation). The moment I woke up has stuck with me, so I relive it a bit when I watch medical shows particularly with a neurosurgeon 😂. Hospital playlist has been on my list for a long time, and I’m really enjoying it right now. #kdrama</seg>
          <seg id="2">My surgeon is really thoughtful. He called the day before because snow was forecast, and as the medical team was fussing over me as I was coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room my surgeon noticed I was opening my eyes and the bandage was in my eyes. I mean plus doing the surgery. But still so disorienting. One of the most scary things I’ve done and I was asleep and it felt like no time.</seg>
          <seg id="3">I was on my period but I was supposed to strip down. So they let me have these mesh underwear you wear after childbirth. But they strip you completely down in the OR and drape you. So at some point a nice nurse replaced my period care before I woke up. Aside from childbirth where I was conscious and getting help or as a baby, I’ve never had such a private care task done for me. That was also my one stay in the ICU. ICU stay was a precaution for my type of surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="4">My surgery involved lots of rest so I watched seasons 1-3 of Grey’s Anatomy. It helped McDreamy was a neurosurgeon. I would pay attention to how the patient was positioned just in the event I could guess what happened to me. Since my surgery in 2018, Hospital Playlist has shown more dramatization of neurosurgery than any other medical show I’ve seen since Grey’s. It is nice to have art and entertainment to help us make sense of our life.</seg>

          <seg id="2">we came up during a golden age of media, with a collective consciousness around pop culture that no longer exists.</seg>
          <seg id="3">we got to jump right into things without having to consider the source, because it wasn't as easy to determine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">with no reason to question the pedestal we put them on, those parasocial relationships became prominent building blocks that shaped our lives.</seg>
          <seg id="5">this is why we have such strong ties to nostalgia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">when The Office was still on the air, my friends and i would order pizza and get together to watch it every thursday.</seg>
          <seg id="7">it was unlike anything we have now with streaming, where 12 episodes are dropped at once and everyone watches at their own pace, prefacing social media posts with “spoiler alerts” or keeping discussion in specified silos.</seg>
          <seg id="8">we subconsciously crave tapping into the universal community that used to surround it all.</seg>
          <seg id="9">it’s why so many of us are still obsessively watching shows like The Office, or movies like Anchorman that provided endless one-line references in a meme-like fashion.</seg>
          <seg id="10">we parroted these references back and forth to one another with the assumption that most people would get it.</seg>
          <seg id="11">these days, even when something goes viral on a massive scale, we can’t assume everyone has seen it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">there is too much to focus on and no way to streamline it … will we ever escape the oversaturation?</seg>
          <seg id="13">we get trapped in cycles of discovering new media only to find out the artist is a predator or bigot.</seg>
          <seg id="14">we are forced to grapple with holding onto nostalgia while acknowledging that the people who created the art we connected with can be extremely flawed.</seg>
          <seg id="15">we step into parasocial relationships more gingerly.</seg>
          <seg id="16">we understand that it is hard to get to these positions of wealth and power without stepping on others along the way.</seg>
          <seg id="17">in the absence of collective consciousness around media, we developed a level of class consciousness that helps us stay critical.</seg>
          <seg id="18">some of us are still putting people on pedestals only to act shocked when they fall.</seg>

          <seg id="2">like back in the 00s you had bionicles, which were essentially adventurers/heroes with elemental powers and actual distinct personalities and hobbies and stuff, but like before and since then its just been stuff like Warhammer, Gundam, Battletech, where everythings geared to being a weapon, showcased to gratuitous effect in accompanying media</seg>
          <seg id="3">and sure, these other sources are AWARE that "war is bad", but then you're still selling the killing machines as figures and merch. So, like, what are we doing?</seg>
          <seg id="4">I imagine the answer is to just kinda divorce the design from its fictional intent, ppl do that with real world tanks and jets after all, but my brain is having a DIFFICULT time w that</seg>
          <seg id="5">Bc the figures do look cool, and I like they way they're constructed, and how the design reflects certain characteristics, but then every set is like "oh by the way here's your laser sword and (at minimum one) gun!"</seg>

          <seg id="16">On a full charge, it gives me a runtime of about 4 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="17">I call this a feature. That way the birds get some privacy too.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Initially, I wasn't sure if the internet in our garden would be good enough for this setup. The old access points I replaced last year in the fall wouldn't have cut it.</seg>
          <seg id="19">But the new ones cover that area just fine.</seg>
          <seg id="20">That is almost a bummer because I was planning on mounting a TP-Link cpe210 on the roof and having it point downwards to the garden.</seg>
          <seg id="21">I still might do that when/if I set up more camera nesting boxes. Especially in areas further from the house, I might need it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Now, for reasons I'm not sure about yet, the camera is offline. It went out only one hour after sunset.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Maybe it stopped charging the battery 3 hours before sunset due to insufficient light.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Maybe it couldn't fully charge up in a little less than half a day.</seg>
          <seg id="25">I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I don't have any telemetry for the battery. This is something I might add in a future revision.</seg>
          <seg id="27">A few more sensors in general would be nice I guess.</seg>
          <seg id="28">And maybe a battery that's at least on paper capable of running the thing over night.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Oh, and a different lens.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Fisheye is way overkill.</seg>
          <seg id="31">But I'm already browsing Digikey for parts, so I might just build myself a custom PCB for this exact use case.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Or not. We'll see.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Aaaand it's still offline.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Great.</seg>
          <seg id="35">According to the proper solar panels on the house the sun is only really up for about 90 minutes.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Let's give it another hour or two to see what it does(n't).</seg>
          <seg id="37">Still offline.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Nothing ever is easy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Turns out the USB-C breakout I was using to plug into the Battery Charger had 5V and GND swapped on the silkscreen.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Swapped over the leads and now I've got a charging light.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The ESP didn't go online immediately, let's give it a few minutes.</seg>
          <seg id="42">One hour later and it's still offline.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Looks like it's reboot-looping and triggering Tasmotas reset feature.</seg>
          <seg id="44">I guess the panel just sucks ass. I now ordered a bigger one, hoping this does the trick.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Look what I found in my Workshop.</seg>
          <seg id="46">It's a 24V Panel. Sadly the sun is so low (and partly obstructed by a tree) that it drops down to basically nothing as soon I put a load on it.</seg>
          <seg id="47">So I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrow to figure out if it actually is enough for this setup or If I need the better panel I ordered.</seg>
          <seg id="48">According to Amazon, I bought the panel in 2021 and It should output 12V at a max of 1.2A.</seg>
          <seg id="49">So either there's something wrong with this panel or my multimeter, or they changed the listing.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Good news everyone!</seg>
          <seg id="51">They changed the listing and the one I have is borked.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Both the old and the new Listing titles call it a 12V 10W panel.</seg>
          <seg id="53">This is why I don't delete old emails.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Hey, look: the thing went back online for like half a minute about one hour ago.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Maybe the panel trickle-charged the battery just enough for 38 seconds of runtime. It only took a bit over two hours to do that.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Guess what: It's cloudy today. So I'm not sure if that (probably broken) solar panel is able to generate enough juice to achieve anything.</seg>
          <seg id="57">Let's wait and see.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Update: I installed the new panel and now it seems to work.</seg>
          <seg id="59">It still might die as soon as the sun goes down, but let's wait and see.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Funfact: I'm using the ping integration in Home Assistant to monitor if it's online or not.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The average round-trip time is 102 ms. Not great not horrible.</seg>

          <seg id="24">If u asked me to describe what flying a small plane is like, I'd say it's a combination of a motorcycle/ATV and a boat at 4000 ft in the air</seg>
          <seg id="25">On the ground things get very fast very quickly. There's a certain Mount of instability on the ground hence motorcycle/atv.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Also if you didn't know, you steer a plane on the ground with your feet, not the control yoke. Rudder pedals and brakes. It's not a car.</seg>
          <seg id="27">In the air it's bumpy and floaty and feels like you're in a boat on the water. You have control, but sometimes a wave knocks you around a little bit, so u need to get your sea legs except in the air.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Imagine a very long web page with lots of sections (e.g., single-page HTML spec). If the user requests a specific section (e.g. page.html#section7), what if the web server streamed that section first and the other sections after that?</seg>
          <seg id="2">Stream order:</seg>
          <seg id="3">1. start of HTML document up to &lt;body&gt;</seg>

          <seg id="7">Does this make sense? Would this be useful?</seg>
          <seg id="8">What I want to achieve is have the linked section (#section7) render as fast as possible without having to re-implement stuff with JavaScript. I just want to have a super long HTML document but still have linked sections render as fast as possible. It should just work with HTML.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The content could be streamed like this, and then the browser would inject each &lt;contents&gt; into its &lt;div&gt;.</seg>
          <seg id="10">&lt;div id=sec1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</seg>
          <seg id="11">&lt;div id=sec2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</seg>

          <seg id="16">etc.</seg>
          <seg id="17">It would be streamed out of order, but the browser would assemble the HTML document as if it were streamed in order.</seg>
          <seg id="18">@user22 You can reorder documents like that without JS even. You can’t use hash part of the URL if you want the server to do something though, but you can use query string search params to let the server know which section you want first. You’ve got a choice for reordering the parts:</seg>
          <seg id="19">1. Use CSS</seg>
          <seg id="20">2. Use template with slots</seg>
          <seg id="21">@user23 Yes. The problem is that the visual order (what the user sees) does not match the DOM order. It may be useful if there existed an HTML feature that would allow streaming out of order, but the browser would then arrange the content in the DOM in order.</seg>
          <seg id="22">But the slots approach looks promising. I’ll give it a try.</seg>
          <seg id="23">@user22 oh, you want the browser to fix up the DOM order?</seg>
          <seg id="24">@user23 Yes, that’s the idea. The section 7 would be streamed first for the sole reason that the user can view it as soon as possible. If that can be made possible without affecting the DOM order, that would be good, so the browser would make sure that the resulting DOM order matches the visual order.</seg>
          <seg id="25">In other words, stream section 7 first but make the end result (DOM and visual) be as if all sections streamed in order.</seg>

And why is that? Because the pantheon was probably built during the Roman era, it is also almost cardinally oriented, which indicates that it cannot be very ancient.</seg>

Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual.

Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reached deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?</seg>

It is a city that divides opinions because of its more modern and urban- looking architecture. Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed during World War II when the Germans attacked the city. Because of this, the city had to be rebuilt, resulting it to look quite different from the other cities in the Netherlands.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Affordable furniture DIYs are always a hit here on Lone Fox, so I wanted to share with you guys how I created this nightstand from a simple crate from IKEA. So this is the Nagle crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just e 6,000 these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to. And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand.</seg>

Knowing everything that I know now. So this is a video that's going to help DIYers or new shinglers not make mistakes and take the proper precautions to get this job done right without wasting time.

We prefer to do it with the hand grinders ourselves, so either way will work pretty good. Usually if it's got an epoxy coating already, the hand grinders work a little better, but this thing looks really good too. So after we do that, we fix all the cracks, fix all the divots with our patch repair material and then we grind them smooth, and then we clean the concrete and get it ready for the first coating. This is going to be a 100 % solids epoxy so it goes on and it's different procedures, different stages.</seg>

          <seg id="4">A click. It had been reruns of this same stream, the day the world was ruined. Dad always found himself turning the channel off when I was unable to tear my eyes away. The somber face he gave me ensured a gut-wrenching feeling transpiring from deep within – I always feel bad when it plays, but it opens the floodgates to so many memories; granted they weren't very good ones. Letting out a sigh, I slowly rose to my feet, gotta get my mind off things. His saddened mood remained, and regularly I’d try to help ease his mood and at least give him a little bit of joy, but today; I’m tired.</seg>
          <seg id="5">I hold a relatively slow pace as I approach the door, giving a small holler to Dad. “I’ll be heading out for a bit, dinner is in the fridge.” No response. Figures. He usually hears me though, he’ll probably be fine. Slowly closing the door behind me, I let another breathy sigh escape as the door completely shut. Nearly forgetting, I place my hand on the cold, metallic scanner that locks the door. If there was anything this apartment had, it was advanced tech, but then again; most places had notable technology–it had been a long time since anyone had used any other different technology.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The cold, rainy night ensued my long overdue walk–exploring the city of Paltricus was a privilege to those who’d been safe from the mutation via escape, or pure luck. The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years. It must be lonely in the great distant sky. Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living. Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat. The mineral that appeased technology, and architecture was a great mineral that extended our foundation of life. Public knowledge only knows so much about this mineral though, mainly because mainly because it’s kept under pretty tough wraps.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Removing myself from clouded thoughts, I found my way to my favorite coffee spot; most people avoid it because rumors were spread that a lapse was found in the area, which was what society has referred to those whom the virus has infected. This never really disturbed me, I’ve had incredible luck my entire life, plus the owner is a great guy. Who would pass up free coffee in exchange for talks and chats late at night?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Walking inside, a loud ring dispelled my discomfort as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled my lungs. Anton, the man who owned the store, was of course the person behind the counter – the place was practically empty except for a few people in the back. Approaching the counter, my feet tired from a long walk, I droop atop one of the stools and yawn. I spot Anton bringing the regular thankfully. “Hey Lilith, Long night?” his raspy voice echoed within the fractals of my brain, “Something of the sort,” I replied shallowly, more tired and tired by the second.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Ready to fix my fatigue, I took a few sips of the coffee placed in front of me. “Business still down since that sighting..?” I spoke quietly, not attempting to scare away the remaining customers that Anton’s unit had. He nodded, cleaning a glass with a rag – this place is technically a bar, but I never really came for drinks. A few murmurs could be heard from behind, but for the most part, the conversation between me and Anton was held rather short tonight. Waving him a small goodbye, I left the shop; with a little more energy than before.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Wandering the dark streets late at night wasn’t usually the best option, but honestly, it was better than staying in that stuffy apartment; hell most of the time you could hear the neighbors having sex more than you could hear your music. With a quick, breathy sigh, I returned my gaze to the walk ahead–I’ll probably make my way towards Al’s Pawnshop; just a place I find junk that looks interesting, as a pastime. Quick regret flushed over me as I heard footsteps close behind, maybe I'm overthinking it, but nobody hung around this place unless they wanted to get mugged, or beaten up. It was popular for its mafia and gang activities…</seg>
          <seg id="11">Isn’t that funny? We have half the manpower left, and we can’t even refrain from hurting one another. I hastily sped up, Al’s was around the corner, so I would be fine inside. A glance behind me ensured that I was no longer being tailed as I stood in front of a bright glowing sign that read, “Alborn’s Pawnshop!” With slower steps, I entered once again–this place was more under the cover, as Alborn would often take in people who’d been mutated and snuck into Paltricus. Upon opening the door, the lights had been shut off, interestingly enough–there was no Al. No refugees. Nothing. Something wasn’t right here.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Stealthily I made my way towards the back of the store, murmurs and talking heard beyond a metal grate which took a few yanks to tear off. Climbing into the vent was the safest and quietest option for me right now; climbing my way through, I’d pick up on conversations and talks between strangely dressed men. I noticed Al inside, chained. Figures he’d get caught eventually.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Alborn was a great guy, but this looked serious. No need to stick my nose out for someone, especially when they seem like they’ve just gotten into trouble with every authority in the city. Yet, I still couldn’t shake the feeling. Letting a silent sigh escape me, I slowly warped off the grate below, dropping down into the quiet room. “Psst. Al. Al!” I whispered, giving a soft yell at his lack of response. “Lilith? What are you doing here..? You’ve gotta leave, he’ll catch you.”</seg>
          <seg id="3">No shit, I silently voiced to myself. Attempting to lockpick the chains that wrapped around his arms, voices closed in on our location, the faint footsteps growing ever louder. “Quick! Get back in the vent, and leave. Do not come back. If we meet again, it won’t be in this city.” He said hurriedly, the flash of panic on his face didn’t help my nerves at all. Listening to his advice. I couldn’t bring myself to stay longer. Fuck, Al. I quickly ran for it after exiting the vent; it hurt a bit to lose such an invaluable friend. Were they moving him to the…other city? So many things were flicking through my slightly scattered mind, and most of them were angry but sad. I’d done numerous kinds of research on the outer cities, and the capital of the infected, Alcatraz, which they named after the prison – felt like it fit the name pretty well from what I’d read. Not to mention the unmutated had cut any remaining connecting land with infected land, it was…tragic.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The walk home was quiet, but so loud. The thoughts infecting my brain were booming, and the regret of not having stayed to help flashed over multiple times. I finally arrived home, almost brought to tears by the dreadful walk in the burst of sounds from the clouds above, the thunderous booms were enough to frighten any person sometimes. Dad was already passed out on the couch, some rerun of an older movie, probably 10-12 years old; sighing, I quietly crept my way back to my room. Flopping in the bed, I wasn’t able to keep my eyes open for long. Before long, slumber crept up on me.</seg>

          <seg id="7">The days rolled past before I could even realize it. It was a few days since Alborn was taken away – to where I had no clue, but I knew he was taken somewhere. Those outfits seemed familiar, but no way was I going to figure it out on the first try. Sighing, I placed my hands on the system in front of me, emanating a red and purple glow – I could hack the security, the place isn’t far, and I doubt they took measures...Maybe I shouldn’t. Of course, against all morals, my fingers moved without my knowing, pulling up multiple screens; god I’m good. I was pretty popular on a couple of websites, they referred to me as “WRAITH.” Which was a pretty catchy name. Granted my name on any site is WR417H, but I like to think the public came up with it.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Moving the surveillance onto my mobile device, I watched each one intently. Nothing. It was like they were never there. That makes no sense. Cameras had tight security, even with remote access. How..? ARGH. I stood angrily, ready to remove some thoughts from my head – I made my way over, sliding on shoes and taking my keys. “I’ll be back soon, Dad.”Silence. Whatever, he didn’t usually respond, he was probably busy doing something more important than me anyway.</seg>
          <seg id="9">With a quick jolt, I felt a shiver enthrall its way down my spine as I made my way out of the apartment; weird. Ignoring the feeling, I urged myself to head towards Al’s to investigate a little, but my legs moved towards Anton’s small bar – it was a pretty calm place, and I definitely needed to talk to someone. Who better than a bartender who owes you something?</seg>
          <seg id="10">Irregularly, Anton’s was pretty busy; it was bustling with activity and new faces that I’ve never seen before – Anton was regularly the only worker, so knowing that he must be pretty stressed. “Hey Barkeep, get me a coffee.” I purposely spoke in a lower tone to throw him off a bit, a small chuckle escaping me seeing his sigh of relief after turning quickly. “God, Lilith, don’t do that to me…” he softly let out, obviously tired. “You seem pretty busy…you need some help? Look’s like there's more than plenty of folks here.” I huffed out, I do not want to help with these drunks, but I feel bad making this guy work alone out here. “Could you? I’ll pay you after…” he uttered with the eyes of a puppy, aimed straight at me. Advanced War Tactics…</seg>
          <seg id="11">After changing into the small uniform, I helped around the bar a bit, it was pretty easy aside from the constant flirting and cat-calling from the people within the bar; but it didn’t really bother me that much to be honest. I’ll talk to Anton after this shift, I still really need to get Al off my mind, though I know I’ll still investigate his place after this, but still…</seg>

          <seg id="1">A burst of flames erupted from Thassalin's jaws as the colossal Thraki set fire to a very specific patch of forest, then circled above, watching for moment. Weirdly, as he had slowed down, the weird screaming noise from behind him had stopped. Thassalin had forgotten he had passengers on his back.</seg>
          <seg id="2">"Come on, Tenuk, you've shapeshifted into a Thraki before!"</seg>
          <seg id="3">"My own flight is very different from being abruptly dragged off by a massive, pink dragon!"</seg>
          <seg id="4">"It's not that bad, right, Kayel?"</seg>
          <seg id="5">Kayel clearly didn't agree with Nyssi, he looked less black than normal and his claws had dug into Thassalin's back to the point that he'd made the Thraki bleed, but Thassalin clearly didn't seem to care. That being said, Thassalin had realized he had scared his new friends and found a clearing to land in.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"I APOLOGIZE BUT I PICKED UP A SCENT. I HAD TO DEAL WITH IT!"</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Did you have to drag us along as well?" Tenuk snapped as he climbed off Thassalin's back, sliding down his tail. "And we left Retvik behind! We abandoned our big, strong, fighty guy! How is he going to get to us?"</seg>
          <seg id="8">"He'll work it out..." Nyssi tutted. "Retvik's slow but he's not stupid."</seg>
          <seg id="9">"Yeah but can Retvik drive?"</seg>
          <seg id="10">Nyssi blinked and turned back to Tenuk. "Of course he can drive."</seg>
          <seg id="11">"Have you ever seen Retvik drive a vehicle? He doesn't own a truck like you do, nor have I seen him drive something like that little cute car Kayel has, and he only started going to work by car because you keep on driving us TO work. He just has that bike of his."</seg>
          <seg id="12">A burst of laughter interrupted them. Thassalin was suddenly overly amused, but no one could work out what he was laughing about. It took a little too long for Thassalin to calm down.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"I AM SORRY, BUT I PICTURED YOUR LARGE, ARMOURED FRIEND ON A TINY LITTLE BIKE MEANT FOR TEMTHAN CHILDREN. IT WAS HILARIOUS! I WISH I HAD SOME FORM OF TELEPATHY. IT IS A CHERISHED THOUGHT! ONE I CANNOT SHARE!"</seg>
          <seg id="14">Kayel snickered, as he could imagine what Thassalin was thinking about. "Yeah, fair. But what did you pick up, and why did you fly off so quickly?"</seg>
          <seg id="15">Thassalin grunted, took off and disappeared briefly, before returning, dropping a carcass in front of Nyssi. It was an Orothrack, a very rare, gold and white draconic creature. But its head was missing. "ANOTHER DEAD ONE. I HEAR THEIR CRIES. SMELL THEIR BLOOD. I AM DRAWN TO PROTECT AND HUNT. AS YISINI DEMANDS. THE CREATURES, THEY ARE CLOSE."</seg>
          <seg id="16">The mighty Thraki suddenly froze. Nyssi and Kayel also froze, their attention drawn to a gap in the clearing. Something large and black was staring at them, hissing. Whatever it was, it spread open two colossal pairs of wings and charged forward, aiming at Thassalin, not caring that it had to go through the three smaller beings. Kayel and Tenuk only just managed to get to cover, but Nyssi found herself dragged along and almost thrown at Thassalin.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Thassalin responded to this attack by grabbing Nyssi and throwing her on his back with his insanely long, dextrous tail, before taking off into the air. The black, two-winged creature quickly chased after them.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Kayel tutted as he drew his rifle from his back, then opened up a pouch, revealing a bandolier. He slung the bandolier over his chest for easy access, but quickly realized that Nyssi, the Thraki and the monster were no longer visible.</seg>
          <seg id="19">"Hey, Tenuk, do you mind shapeshifting into something that can fly?" Kayel asked.</seg>
          <seg id="20">"You want to chase after them?"</seg>
          <seg id="21">"Yeah, duh."</seg>
          <seg id="22">"But... one of them is a giant monster!"</seg>
          <seg id="23">"So? I have a high-powered rifle in my hands, right now, ready to go. I just need to be able to, you know, see it, so I can shoot it."</seg>
          <seg id="24">Tenuk hesitated, then stepped back, giving himself some space. With a low, slightly pained grunt, Tenuk's body stretched out, his fur replaced with scales and his arms replaced with wings. He quickly turned himself into a normal, light blue Thraki, but his eyes remained red.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"Climb on."</seg>
          <seg id="26">Being a more normal-looking Thraki, Tenuk now had proper plates of scales running down his back, but he'd also conveniently grown a pair of spikes on his back for Kayel to hold on to. It took a little too long for Tenuk to get airborne, but once he was in the air, he quickly orientated himself and tried to give chase.</seg>
          <seg id="27">However, Tenuk and Kayel quickly realized they weren't alone. A second dark creature shot out from beneath them, and Tenuk only just managed to avoid a collision.</seg>
          <seg id="28">"I guess that's the other big scary monster that Lanex was worried about?" Kayel frowned as he attempted to take a shot at the second beast, missed and swiftly reloaded.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Tenuk didn't respond, he was too busy concentrating on flying towards Nyssi and Thassalin, even though the other creature was chasing them. Kayel awkwardly turned himself around, so he could face the monster. The fact that it was giving chase was good news in Kayel's eyes, as it made it easier for him to aim and fire. Two shots passed through the creature's top wings, and it roared in pain, disappearing back below the trees. Whether it was still following them, Kayel wasn't sure, but it certainly wouldn't have been able to keep up.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Up ahead, Nyssi was clinging on for dear life as Thassalin flailed around, blasting the blackened monster with bursts of flame. While the creature was definitely injured, it seemed very pissed off and unwilling to back off, and the fire balls didn't seem to be doing as much as they should. As Thassalin straightened himself out though, Nyssi took this as an opportunity to pull out her own weapon, a trusty shotgun. Sure, it wasn't meant for this sort of thing, but surely the scattershot would at least deter the black beast?</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">No, clearly not. The creature just hissed and tried to fly directly into Thassalin. Thankfully, despite his size, Thassalin was nimble enough to get out of the way, but Nyssi couldn't help but scream as she very nearly lost her grip on Thassalin's overly smooth scales.</seg>
          <seg id="2">"HOW DO WE KILL THEM?" Nyssi shouted.</seg>
          <seg id="3">"AIM FOR THEIR HEADS!"</seg>
          <seg id="4">"THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY!"</seg>
          <seg id="5">Thassalin hissed, then circled round, closer to the mountain he called home. The dark beast followed, but somewhat panicked as a blast of fire hit it from behind. The creature hadn't realised it was no longer alone. It panicked further as Thassalin slowed down then thwacked his tail into the side of the beast's head, knocking it off course.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Snarling and hissing, the creature flew upwards, spitting into the air. Everything suddenly went dark, as if the monster was sucking the light from the sky itself, replacing it with a cloud of perpetual night.</seg>
          <seg id="7">No longer able to see, Thassalin tried to retreat, but found himself scraping against the top of the treeline, before crashing into a clearing. The creature seemed to know exactly where Thassalin had fallen and headed straight for him, taking the dark cloud with it.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Kayel!" Tenuk exclaimed as he glided out of the cloud and began circling, trying to spot Nyssi and Thassalin in the darkness below. "What do we do? Kayel..? Kayel, where are you?"</seg>
          <seg id="9">Below, Nyssi scrambled to her feet. She was pretty sure she had broken something, but her weird, unnatural healing powers had already kicked in. The same couldn't have been said for Thassalin, who was lying in a lump, resting against the one tree that hadn't collapsed under his weight. Nyssi did her best to try and reach Thassalin but she could barely see more than a couple of meters in front of her. Everything was pitch black and engulfed in unholy shadows. And in said shadows, something was screaming and screeching.</seg>
          <seg id="10">A horrible, clubbed tail smashed into the ground near Nyssi, knocking her over. She noticed though that the tail was flailing, not aiming at her. The creature, what little Nyssi could see and hear of it, was snarling and clawing at the shadows it had created. Something was teleporting through the darkness, stabbing at the monster, confusing it.</seg>
          <seg id="11">A gunshot suddenly filled the air, and the monster fell silent, collapsing on the ground and remaining still. The darkness all around them dissipated, revealing what had happened. Standing on top of the creature was Kayel, holding his rifle and breathing heavily.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"That was... one of the weirder shadowjumps I've ever done... Thanto kat'olon..." Kayel gasped for air. His eyes somehow were glowing black, and a dark energy drifted across his body. However, as he spoke, the colour returned to Kayel's organic plating and his eyes turned back to their normal yellow.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It took a moment for Nyssi to work out what had happened. They were all aware that Kayel had weird shadow powers, ones that he rarely used because most considered them unholy and rather terrifying. But Nyssi didn't know that Kayel could use those powers in any sort of darkness. And, by the way Kayel was acting, he was pretty surprised as well.</seg>
          <seg id="14">"You alright?" Nyssi couldn't help but ask.</seg>
          <seg id="15">"Yeah, I'm fine. I killed something, I'll be good in a minute." Kayel examined his handiwork, as Tenuk made his way down and landed next to him, shapeshifting back into his normal Spast form.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Now that the creature was no longer moving, they could better see what it was. Its skin was pitch black and slimy, but the slime remained firmly attached to the creature's body. It had four wings and four limbs, all of which were tipped with long, thin talons, and two straight horns stuck out from its skull.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Before Tenuk and Kayel could ask what the fuck they were looking at, something screeched and leaped out from a nearby bush. However, it never made contact, as a familiar vehicle crashed into the side of it, causing the monster to skid to a halt by Nyssi's feet. Not taking any chances, Nyssi grabbed her shotgun and immediately fired into its skull, killing the creature instantly.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"Oops..." Retvik muttered from the driver's seat, before awkwardly switching the engine off and climbing out of the truck. "I, uh, did not mean to do that. Are you all well?"</seg>
          <seg id="19">"You missed basically all the action!" Tenuk tutted. "Where were you?"</seg>
          <seg id="20">"You all did somewhat leave me behind. I got here as quickly as I could..." Retvik sighed. "May I ask, what are those horrible things?"</seg>
          <seg id="21">Retvik's question was thankfully answered by Thassalin, who had picked himself back up. He was covered in cuts and scratches and seemed a bit dazed, but he didn't seem too badly injured.</seg>
          <seg id="22">"YOU KILLED THE CORRUPTIIDS! THE INFECTED MONSTERS. CREATURES LEFT HERE WHEN THE CORRUPTION ATTACKED YOUR GODS."</seg>
          <seg id="23">"You mean... the horrible god monster thing that we... helped kill?" Tenuk stuttered.</seg>
          <seg id="24">"YES. VERY MUCH SO. THERE MAY BE MORE. BUT I COULD NOT SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD. I LACK A GUN. ALSO TWO AGAINST ONE IS UNFAIR, YES?" Thassalin made his way over to Kayel and patted him on the head. "THANK YOU, LITTLE ONE. YOU REMIND ME OF MY OLD FRIEND ARKADIN. EXCEPT LESS MURDEROUS AND LESS CAPABLE OF KILLING UNIVERSES."</seg>
          <seg id="25">"Uh... thanks... I guess..." Kayel shrugged. "So, uh, are we done here?"</seg>
          <seg id="26">Nyssi shrugged, then grabbed her camera, taking some photos of the definitely now dead beasts. She then pulled out her favourite dagger, her fancy, death-god-y one, and started cutting off one of the creature's horns, before moving on to the other one. However, just as Nyssi finished, the creatures suddenly began to burn up, and quickly turned into a pile of ashes. The same thing happened to the horns Nyssi had cut off.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"Well... that is both convenient and inconvenient..." Nyssi sighed. "I suppose at least I got pictures?"</seg>

          <seg id="1">Prologue</seg>
          <seg id="2">“Please!” Queen Eirwen begged, “don’t send her away! She’s just a child!” The Ice King looked down at his wife from his throne, his royal advisor next to him. She had given birth to a girl. He scowled at the thought.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The girl in question looked a lot like her mother; pale blue eyes and white hair decorated with blue strands. The Ice King thought a daughter made him look weak. After all, he had only had sons up until this point.</seg>
          <seg id="4">“The only options you have are to kill the child or send it out to the wilderness. This is her punishment for your wrongdoing, Eirwen .” He spat out her name as if it was poison. He always did.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Frostfell was not always one kingdom. It was split in two, the North and the South. In the North, the non magical kingdom. To the South, a kingdom full of fantastical displays of power. Due to the North’s greed, the two kingdoms clashed in a never ending war, until the South offered a truce.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The South was desperate, and their royal family would do anything to stop the bloodshed. They offered their only princess to be queen of the North and bear a son to be the future king. Then, the South would join with the North to make one kingdom. The North accepted, and Princess Eirwen married Prince Akull.</seg>
          <seg id="7">“I beg you, my king, in return for the safety of my child, do whatever you want to me, lock me up, banish me, or even kill me.” Queen Eirwen pleaded, holding her child tightly in her arms.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The Ice King looked down at his queen, disgust from his eyes. Maybe, just maybe, he would have mercy on her. The woman who he had been with for twenty-two years, the one who always cared for him at his lowest times, the one who had given birth to his sons.</seg>
          <seg id="9">“Very well. The child may live in the palace.” He started, earning a sigh from the queen. “But,” he added. “You will be executed.”</seg>
          <seg id="10">A shared look of horror came from the advisor and Queen Eirwen herself. She slowly looked down at the floor. “Yes, my king.” She bowed.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Ice King ordered the royal advisor to take the queen’s daughter to one of Eirwen’s vacant rooms. Once that was done he ordered the guards to bring Eirwen to the execution site, where all the townspeople could see.</seg>
          <seg id="12">As the guards escorted her to the site, the townspeople cried out in outrage at seeing their only queen- and the nicest one- about to be killed. Some people were crying, some people were shouting and trying to attack the guards, and others were wondering why this was happening; but they all shared the same basis.</seg>
          <seg id="13">“Let her go!”</seg>
          <seg id="14">“Why are they doing this to her?”</seg>
          <seg id="15">As Eirwen approached the wooden pole, the most feared person in the kingdom showed up. The fire user. The former Queen Eirwen was going to be burned to death. Nobody deserved that death, not even the criminals. It was the most cruel thing you could do to a person in Frostfell.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Eirwen was tied up to the wooden pole and the king started speaking about how the queen betrayed all of them. The people of Frostfell refused to believe it and never accepted his words. Then, the fire user lit the pole on fire, and a single tear rolled down the former queen’s face.</seg>
          <seg id="17">“Live on, Kari.” That was the end of the reign of Queen Eirwen.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Silence in the Halls</seg>
          <seg id="19">Tap, tap, tap was all you could hear from the farthest room on the left in the south wing of the eternally cold palace. The servants passing by always wondered what was in the room, scared of what was inside. Rumors danced around the halls by the maids. It was thought that the Ice King’s deceased wife, Eirwen, was in that room, waiting to be let out.</seg>
          <seg id="20">They couldn’t be more wrong. Ivory thought, walking toward the south wing, as the help roamed the walls whispering to each other. They don’t know what’s in there at all.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The rumors, of course, also applied to them as they were the only person allowed to enter the room.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Knock knock. “Lady Kari, are you in there?” Ivory whispered to the intricate door, which was laid in snowflakes and a crown, the symbol of the royal family.</seg>
          <seg id="23">They wondered if she would actually let them enter, unlike the previous times they went to ask. I still have a bruise from the last time. Ivory chuckled from the memory. Kari had thrown a book at their shoulder, but when she saw who it was, she apologized immediately.</seg>
          <seg id="24">A single tap came from inside, seeming to say that she was there, after all, there was nowhere to go.</seg>
          <seg id="25">“May I come in?” Ivory asked, remembering the time they went in without asking.</seg>
          <seg id="26">One tap came from inside. Yes, it seemed to say. Ivory shivered, from the cold and the sound. It felt kind of weird to Ivory hearing a noise coming from a presumably vacant room, even though they have been going into there for years.</seg>
          <seg id="27">“I’m coming in.” Ivory said, slowly opening the door. The sight they saw in the room was unusual , by normal people’s standards , but not unexpected. Papers were everywhere. Books were scattered about, the desk was broken, and there were multiple ice sculptures scattered about. There were no windows and little to no light. It was also colder than the rest of the palace (which was saying a lot). The room looked like a snowstorm blew it all out of place.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The girl in the room was curled up onto her bed, currently wrapped in her comforter as she read one of her notebooks. A small lantern lighting up the space.</seg>
          <seg id="29">“Which notebook is that?” Ivory asked, sitting down next to Kari on her bed.</seg>
        </p>

      <src lang="en">
        <p>
          <seg id="1">She flipped to a blank page and wrote the date on it. Under it, she wrote, “5/11/648 -12/13/648.”</seg>
          <seg id="2">“Reviewing old memories?” Ivory inquired, looking at the old notebook. Kari nodded. “Do you think that they will let you out for Christmas? It’s only a few days away.”</seg>
          <seg id="3">Kari tapped twice on the lantern. No, as Ivory predicted. The Ice King never let Kari out, as she was seen as “a flaw” in his eyes. She was born mute and was the only girl in her family, as it was all made up of boys.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ivory was too, in their own special way. When Ivory came out as nonbinary, it seemed like the world changed too. They were given the jobs that would make them spend time alone for most of the time, as a punishment for being different.</seg>
          <seg id="5">They were also forced to work as the princess’ servant. They didn’t mind it much thought, as they got a friend too.</seg>
          <seg id="6">“It’s your birthday soon, isn’t it?” Ivory asked, remembering that the princess’ birthday was in a few days. Kari nodded, a sad glint in her light blue eyes.</seg>
          <seg id="7">“Do you want to celebrate?” They asked, reflecting on the last time she answered it.</seg>
          <seg id="8">No. Kari tapped out. Ivory knew that it was a hard subject for her. It was the day that she was confined to her room and her mother was banished. Ivory was only a baby when it happened, but they remembered the outrage the servants and townspeople were in. They heard Queen Eirwen was a nice queen, but also weirdly predicted things that would happen.</seg>
          <seg id="9">“So… whatcha wanna do?” They asked. Kari looked up at them, teeming with excitement. She handed Ivory a paper. When they looked down at it however…</seg>
          <seg id="10">6in x 6in painting canvas</seg>
          <seg id="11">White, varying shades of blue paint</seg>
          <seg id="12">6 different sizes of paint brushes</seg>
          <seg id="13">Easel</seg>
          <seg id="14">“You want me to get these things for you?” Ivory turned toward the silent princess, who was tapping a lot, pig tails swishing back and forth. “Yes?” They giggled slightly as they saw the normally withdrawn princess was passionate about something. It was the first time she had ever asked for something not related to books that was outside her room.</seg>
          <seg id="15">“Okay! See ya later?” Ivory asked, standing up and weaving through the mess of papers and notebooks.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Kari nodded, going back to reviewing her memories and curling up in her thick comforter.</seg>
          <seg id="17">They exited the room, relieved that the princess was finally pushing out of her comfort zone and asking for things outside of her power, like paint.</seg>
          <seg id="18">They walked through the halls again, trying to tune out the whispers of the maids again.</seg>
          <seg id="19">“ I heard that she’s getting possessed by Queen Eirwen, that’s why she’s always going to that room.”</seg>
          <seg id="20">“I heard that she eats children in that room.”</seg>
          <seg id="21">“ She looks like a man, isn’t that wrong?”</seg>
          <seg id="22">They covered their ears, as tuning them out wasn’t working. They made their way to the royal painter’s room, which was on the east wing, second door on the left.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Ivory approached the door that was just as intricate as Kari’s. On it was the White Dragon, one of the 6 primordial dragons, who allegedly created Frostfell. It would make sense for the painter to have it on his door though, he liked history.</seg>
          <seg id="24">They opened the door, expecting the normal sight. Paint splotches everywhere, pencils and papers scattered across the room, easels covering up every last inch of wall. Unexpectedly, there was a different sight to be found. It was all clean, and there was a red velvet background and a stool in front of it. On the stool was Crown Prince Aquilo, getting his portrait done.</seg>
          <seg id="25">“Ah, good morning, Ivory! Care to watch your future king get his portrait done?” Aquilo inquired, winking at Ivory.</seg>
          <seg id="26">“Sorry, princey,” They said, partially ignoring him and searching for the things that their silent friend wanted. “I’m just here to get art supplies.”</seg>
          <seg id="27">“Aw baby girl’s gonna leave so soon?” Aquilo asked, “But I wanted to see you!”</seg>
          <seg id="28">“Well I didn’t.” Ivory found the art supplies on their list and put it in a crate that they found. “And I’m not a girl.”</seg>
          <seg id="29">The prince didn’t think this though. “Aw baby, you know it’s just a phase! You’re going to grow out of it when you’re older!” He said, slurring his words.</seg>
          <seg id="30">“I have to go.” They said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable when the prince said back. Remembering all the bad things people said about their gender identity. I really want to get away from him.</seg>
          <seg id="31">“Leaving so soon?” The prince instantaneously appeared at the door, ignoring the cries of one royal painter.</seg>
          <seg id="32">“This isn’t the way a future king should act!” They demanded.</seg>
          <seg id="33">“Nobody’s gonna know. The people won’t believe you and the painter won’t say anything if he values his life.” He looked back at the painter for a second, then leaned closer to Ivory. “Whatddya say about going on a date?” They shivered. Sure, they had heard multiple threats in the past, but it had never come from a prince, let alone the one next in line to be king.</seg>
          <seg id="34">“Do you even know what the word ‘no’ means?” They spat out, pushing the crown prince away from them.</seg>
          <seg id="35">“Nope.” Aquilo answered back, smiling. Of course the crown prince who gets everything he wants doesn’t know what the word even means.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Ivory rolled their eyes. “Why do you even want to go on a date with me of all people? You have like, I don’t know, 100 suitors?”</seg>
          <seg id="37">He cut in, still smiling, “500 actually.” He threw his hair back, swishing it in the cold air.</seg>
          <seg id="38">“See! Why me of all people? I’m the palace menace.” They hugged their arms.</seg>
          <seg id="39">“You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.” Aquilo puts one digit under their chin and forces Ivory to look up at him.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Chapter 1</seg>
          <seg id="2">Cohren</seg>
          <seg id="3">0430 Itania time. Cohren hated waking up this early. Mainly because it was his responsibility to wake everyone else up in his company. Silently stepping out of his bunk, he put on his combat fatigues, throwing on his assault vest, and packed up his belongings from his locker, being careful with a particular small box. He shoulded his rifle and put his helmet on a small hook connected to his belt. It had all its fixing, respirator, goggles, everything needed. After checking his ammo pouches, he quietly walked out of the barracks, mud and ice squelching under his boots.</seg>
          <seg id="4">He took a lighter from his jacket pocket and a cig from the other. Lighting it, he took a small drag before opening the door slightly. Over the last week he had to get creative when waking the men and women under his command. He stopped using the preset wake up alarm, half the time it never worked, when all that came from the speakers was a light hiss.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“Waking them up” Cohren turned to see 2nd Lieutenant Nemic walking up.</seg>
          <seg id="6">“Yup” Cohren responded.</seg>
          <seg id="7">“What did you plan on using this time?”</seg>
          <seg id="8">Before he could answer, the door opened and Harris, Craith, and a few others hurried out, already fully dressed and kitted out.</seg>
          <seg id="9">“Morning,” Craith said.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“What woke you guys up?” Cohren asked.</seg>
          <seg id="11">“Well, One, we didn’t want to see what you had in mind for waking the company up today. Second, the first Shock Troops to get up get first pick of the morning chow” One of the men, Ravik, answered. “And you know for a fact how bad they can get”</seg>
          <seg id="12">“You make a good point Specialist,” Cohren said. He reached in and flicked a switch. An alarm sounded inside of the barracks, loud and screeching. He heard muffled shouting inside and people stumbling about.</seg>
          <seg id="13">“Jeez Valturi,” Nemic stated. “You’d think they would have learned by now to wake up when you did”</seg>
          <seg id="14">“Well my buddys from boot camp here did” Cohren motioned to Harris, Craith and Ravik. “But then again, their squad and platoon leader’s, they know to wake up before their units.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Seconds later the rest of the company came streaming out. They all had everything they needed, from personal items to needed gear. A few of the newer recruits look disoriented, others more annoyed.</seg>
          <seg id="16">“Morning everyone” Cohren said in a cheery voice.</seg>
          <seg id="17">“With all respect sir, why do you have to wake us up like that?” One of the Shock Troopers, a corporal, asked.</seg>
          <seg id="18">“Cause the regular alarms are shit. And because Daybreak doesn't sleep in” Cohren stated.</seg>
          <seg id="19">“Make sure you have all your personal belongings,” Cohren continued. As a 1st Lieutenant and Company XO, it was his responsibility to oversee and assist the company with the Company leader, Captain Boradin Shaw . “We won’t be returning. Sergeants and 2nd lieutenants, I'm giving you and your squads fifteen minutes to make final checks and grab rations for the day”</seg>
          <seg id="20">The members of Exodus company quickly dispersed. They were a part of the 2nd Shocktrooper Division, 2nd Army. They were originally two separate companies, Cohort and Dagger, before being consolidated. They were a cracked company, and Cohren felt mixed feelings about being promoted to 1st Lieutenant, mainly due to the reasons.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Cohren and Nemic, the leader of 1st Platoon, walked together under the light of the FOB's many lights, powered by generators. Most were tinted red to help keep them hidden from enemy bombers. Daybreak had resorted to Wild Weasel attacks, both in the air and on the ground, to combat them.</seg>
          <seg id="22">“Another day, another task for Hell’s Frontrunners” Nemic started with a dry laugh. “Where are they sending us?”</seg>
          <seg id="23">“A FOB outside Ianlos. We are being sent to help support the ground assault” Cohren answered, taking a drag from his cigarette. Half of him blamed Craith for getting him into smoking, but a year of combat does a lot to you, so he didn’t say anything.</seg>
          <seg id="24">“Shit. Its getting bad on the front, '' Nemic muttered. “All the news leaving this place is ‘Support the war effort. Send aid to the Kurgan Front’ how about sending aid to the Howland Front”</seg>
          <seg id="25">“Amen brother” Cohren said as he flicked the remains of the cigarette into the mud. “Anyway, we're heading out with the 1st armored platoon, so we don’t have to walk. Captain Shaw should be their”</seg>
          <seg id="26">“Shaw got us a ride?” Nemic asked, a little surprised.</seg>
          <seg id="27">“Yup. Honestly, he isn’t as bad as I thought he was. I mean, he’s not great, but he isn’t unbearable”</seg>
          <seg id="28">Cohren lifted his thumb and index finger to his throat mic, shifting his pack on his back while he did. “All units in Exodus Company, meet at Motor Pool West when you're finished. We are heading out with the 1st Armored Platoon at 0500”</seg>
          <seg id="29">Every few seconds he got a response from the squad leaders. Haris, Craith, and Ravik had all been low ranking NCO when they all got there. All four of them had been good friends since basic back on Earth. It felt so long ago now since Cohren had met them, even though it couldn’t have been two years ago. They were squad leaders, But Craith was now leading 2nd Platoon as of a week ago, after the previous leader had gotten medically discharged after catching a bullet from a Daybreak sniper.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Walking up to the motor pool, Cohren and Nemic’s eye fell on a group of around eight Kronos Main Battle Tanks and four Strykers. Their crew milled about, making sure their war machines were ready to go. Cohren’s gaze soon found Captain Boradin Shaw, who was talking with the armored platoon’s commander. As they walked up, Shaw looked over and walked up, his usually cold face masking all emotions.</seg>
          <seg id="31">“Lieutenant Nemic…Lieutenant Valturi…” He said Cohren was slower, glancing at Cohren’s pistol holster before glancing up again. “I assume that the company is ready”</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">“Yes sir. There should be on their way now, we gave them time to grab rations from the mess” 	At 0500 sharp, Exodus company assembled at the motor pool. Shaw stepped onto a box and began to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="2">“Where are moving out to FOB I-131, fifty miles outside of Ianlos. We are to support the ongoing siege and later attack of Ianlos to flush out the insurgency there. From there we will have a foothold and the base of the mountains” Shaw explained. “Get with your squads and mount up”</seg>
          <seg id="3">The company dispersed, joining together in their squads and their sergeants had them mount up on one of the tanks. Cohren pulled himself onto one of the tanks farther up on the convoy, joining Nemic, Craith, and two new recruits. Cohren remembered them arriving a few days ago, but didn’t know much about them. Sitting on the side, dangling his legs on the side, he adjusted his pack and radio set, which connected to his earpiece and throat mic.</seg>
          <seg id="4">“Hey Cohren, does Harris still have Snowball?” Nemic asks as they got settled in.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“You mean his chicken he stole?” Cohren remembered the morning they had stolen him from a farm. “Yeah, i'm pretty sure”</seg>
          <seg id="6">Cohren glanced over to one of the other tanks and spotted Harris with his squad. From the back of his pack he could just make out the movement of a small chicken moving its head around, scanning the surroundings.</seg>
          <seg id="7">“Yup, he still has him” Cohren answered as the tank's turret hatch clanked open and its commander came into view.</seg>
          <seg id="8">“All tanks were moving out” The commander started calmly but clearly into his headset. The engines of a platoon of tanks and Strykers roared to life as they started moving forward. The Kronos Cohren was on jolted as its break released and moved forward, getting into formation. The tanks took up a wedge formation as they moved across the Itania plains. The winter storms had frozen over the wetlands and forests, but the mud always remained.</seg>
          <seg id="9">After around an hour, one of the new recruits, Cohren, remembered his name being Orson, spoke up. “Lieutenant, you’ve been here since the start of the war, right?”</seg>
          <seg id="10">“Yup, Operation Firestorm,” Cohren answered. “We thought it would be over in a few weeks, but…we underestimate them”</seg>
          <seg id="11">“Underestimated is putting it lightly” Nemic joined in the conversation. “They had more weapons and manpower than we were prepared for. They were able to shoot down The UFS Revenant in the first two weeks, and just last month the Erebus. Hell, we should see it from the route were taking”</seg>
          <seg id="12">“Well, I’ll stand defiantly for the Federation” Orson said defiantly. “I’ll not let those terrorist scare me”</seg>
          <seg id="13">“You say that now, but from what I have seen, most fresh eighteen year old recruits like yourself dive to cover as soon as you hear a gunshot” Craith stated.</seg>
          <seg id="14">“I guess we’ll find out,” Cohren said with a laugh. Orson didn’t continue the conversation.</seg>
          <seg id="15">“Exodus XO, Exodus CO” Cohrens radio crackled. “We're picking up heat signatures 350 yards out, 20 degrees right”</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cohren pulled himself up to the top of the tank and pushed his Optic Goggles. Switching them to Thermal, he could see heat signatures in the distance.</seg>
          <seg id="17">“Yup, I see them” Cohren responded, using his throat mic.</seg>
          <seg id="18">“Enemy’s?” The other recruit, Natayla, asked.</seg>
          <seg id="19">“Can’t tell,” Cohren stated. He reached for his mic and spoke. “Exodus Company, hold fire unless fired upon, let's draw them out</seg>
          <seg id="20">As they drew closer, the little heat signatures turned from blobs to more distinct shapes. As they drew closer, one of them ran for something and grabbed it before rusing back to the small ridge they were on. The figures dropped down into firing positions.</seg>
          <seg id="21">“We got contacts” Shaw shouted through the radio as orange tracers fired from the ridge. Bullets pinged off the tanks side as Shock Troopers leaped off the tanks, taking cover behind them. An anti missile rocked, streaked by and slammed into the ground behind the formation, exploding and throwing debris onto one of the tanks. Another slammed into the side of a Stryker, a APS-Cerberus, and exploded. Its crew scrambled out and dove for cover as the ammo cooked off.</seg>
          <seg id="22">“Iron 1-2 and 1-3, 25 degrees right, 300 yards. Open fire” The tank platoon commander shouted over the radio. Iron 1-2 and 1-3 opened fire, their shells streaking towards the ridge and exploded, sending mud and rock into the air.</seg>
          <seg id="23">“Send in the Senti’s” Knoxx, who was watching the ridge through binocs, shouted. The back to one of the Cerberus’s opened and an unarmed soldier stepped out, wearing a special headset. He shouted orders into a square microphone and two Senti’s, formally known as Sentinels, rushed out. Their skinny metallic arms and legs swung forward as they broke into a sprint. They were armed, but their weapons were slung to their back.</seg>
          <seg id="24">“Kill or capture?” Craith asked as they watched.</seg>
          <seg id="25">“Looks like capture” Cohren guessed as the two Sentinels disappeared into the cloud of ash and smoke. Shouting and gunshots echoed from the ridge, but quickly ceased. A moment later the two sentinels marched back, pulling someone behind them, their boots dragging behind them. When they reached the safety of the platoon they threw the figure to the ground, he grunted in pain as they landed hard in the mud and snow.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Shaw walked up to the figure, who was starting to get up. He then turned to one of the Sentinels. “How many?”</seg>
          <seg id="27">“Three dead, sir” The Sentinel answered. “The rest fled on foot”</seg>
          <seg id="28">Shaw nodded and turned towards Cohren and Criath, who were standing close by. “Would you two be so kind as to stow this man away?”</seg>

          <seg id="2">This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.</seg>

          <seg id="18">I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.</seg>
          <seg id="19">She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I was like “ok, great, thanks!”</seg>
          <seg id="21">4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.</seg>

          <seg id="2">the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.</seg>

So you're going to use charts and we already clicked on the Layer tabs. The other important thing to do right now is I think it's going to be more helpful to use the map view rather than this globe view, because it's going to be hard to get a sense. You can always reign by clicking this button here so that the North Pole will be straight up. But what I would have you do right now is click on this button right here, which is our map view.</seg>

This results in a forced deception of your emotional state, leading to both physical and mental health issues that impose additional stress on your body. You are at risk of having an outburst of emotions. This is all most likely due to deep emotional scarring, like dealing with the death of a loved one. You feel like it's better to not feel anything to relieve the pain of grief. Over time, these emotions start to build up and can be much more harmful when they burst out during a meltdown.</seg>

The boat goes every half an hour, and you could choose if you wanted to do an open air or closed boat. I wanted to do an open air one despite the weather not being the best. They provided blankets and even umbrellas but luckily we didn't need to use those. The ride takes about 50 minutes.</seg>

I want to be seen as a serious documentarian, but lately all I've been doing are these meaningless documentaries on piss poor indie bands with no future. Still, must feel pretty good to take a break from all that and come out here, huh?</seg>

Yeah, I think that, and I think that you can see the role of the internet in shaping the discourse on a few key issues. Take, for example, the healthcare plans of the candidates. I think that I think that but for the influence of new online opinion outlets, Hillary Clinton would have offered a more conservative health plan. I think that's certainly what Obama expected her to do, at least initially. And I think that I think that ultimately, you know, that certainly shaped how Obama responded.</seg>
