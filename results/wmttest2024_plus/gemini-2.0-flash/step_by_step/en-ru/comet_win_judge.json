The first translation keeps a more direct structure, while the second uses an adjective in an alternative form.\n   \n   2. **\"нормальные пластины чешуи\" vs \"настоящими пластинами чешуи\"**: Translation-1 uses \"нормальные\" while Translation-2 uses \"настоящими\". The second implies authenticity rather than normality.\n   \n   3. **\"ухватиться за них\" vs \"держаться за них\"**: In Translation-1, the phrase used is \"ухватиться за них\" (to grasp them), while Translation-2 uses \"держаться за них\" (to hold onto them).

Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well.

Expression Choice: Translation-1 uses \"что-то в этом роде\" while Translation-2 opts for \"что-то подобное\". The phrases convey a similar meaning but differ in wording (i.e., \"в этом роде\" vs. \"подобное\").\n   4. Negation Placement: In Translation-1, the negation \"не\" is placed before \"нужна библиотека\", while in Translation-2, it follows \"даже\".\n\n2. Addressing of differences in the Analysis:\n   1. Word Order: Implicitly addressed - the analysis discusses the idiomatic expressions in context but does not specify word order.\n   2. Use of \"да\": Explicitly addressed - the analysis focuses on understanding the idiomatic expression, which implies the importance of filler words like \"да\".\n   3. Expression Choice: Implicitly addressed - understanding idiomatic differences suggests variations in expression but is not directly analyzed.\n   4.
