Translation-2 suggests a physical change (puffed cheeks) that does not necessarily convey the same sense of confidence and may imply a different emotional state.\n   3. **Structure:**\n      - Translation-1 maintains a more straightforward structure with a focus on expressing the action of becoming bold. Translation-2 introduces an image that does not directly relate to audacity but rather a descriptive state.\n   4. **Semantic Clarity:**\n      - Translation-1 clearly conveys the intended meaning of gaining boldness, while Translation-2 is more ambiguous and may confuse the reader regarding its relation to the original phrase \"cheeked up.\"\n\n2.

    "About 450 million years ago, plants took a giant leap out of the oceans onto the land to become the plants that we know and love today. But how did they survive? Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?": [

Translation-1 uses \"效果都很好\" (works well), while Translation-2 uses \"效果都很好\" as it is phrased in a different context without \"pretty\".\n   5. Translation-1 employs \"修复所有的裂缝和坑洼\" (fix all the cracks and divots) while Translation-2 says \"修补所有的裂缝，用我们的修补材料填补所有的凹坑\" (repair all the cracks, fill all the divots with our repair material) – this difference introduces \"我们的修补材料\" and changes wordings.\n   6.

The expression \"在过去的 77 年里\" (in the past 77 years) in Translation-1 is rendered as \"在过去的77年中\" (in the past 77 years) in Translation-2; the change is in the usage of \"里\" vs. \"中.\"\n   5.

Explicitly: The expression \"献出一切\" (gave everything) is discussed in the Analysis, related to emotional significance.\n   2.

The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years. It must be lonely in the great distant sky. Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living. Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat.

The first emphasizes intention, while the second suggests causation.\n   2. **\"探索帕尔特里克斯城\" vs. \"探索帕尔特里克斯市\"**: Translation-1 refers to \"帕尔特里克斯城\" (City of Paltricus), while Translation-2 uses \"帕尔特里克斯市\" (Paltricus City). The difference is between the terms for \"city.\"\n   3. **\"闪耀着鲜艳的星星\" vs. \"充满活力的星星\"**: Translation-1 describes the stars as \"充满活力的\" (vibrant), while Translation-2 describes them as \"闪耀着鲜艳的星星\" (shining with bright stars). This difference reflects a variation in imagery.\n   4. **\"感觉得更像是一个笼子\" vs. \"给人的感觉更像是一个笼子\"**: Translation-1 uses \"感觉\" (feels), while Translation-2 phrases it as \"给人的感觉\" (gives the impression).

    "Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved. Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis. Anything else is simply not going to work.": [

Syntax: Translation-1 has a direct structure, stating the time frame of the collective consciousness first, while Translation-2 rearranges the elements for clarity and emphasis, placing the notion of the past collective consciousness in a subordinate position.\n   3. Emphasis: Translation-1 states \"不再存在\" directly connecting it to \"集体意识,\" making the absence seem like part of the previous condition. In contrast, Translation-2 separates the existence of the consciousness from its current state more explicitly, indicating that it no longer exists \"如今,\" which adds an element of time.\n   4.
