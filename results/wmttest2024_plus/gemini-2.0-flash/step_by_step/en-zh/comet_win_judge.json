Analysis of Differences:\n\n   1. **Wording**: This difference is implicitly addressed in the analysis under the pre-drafting research focus, as it mentions identifying idiomatic expressions.

There is no significant difference regarding the name transliteration, so this point does not differ.\n   3. **Tone and Style**: Both translations maintain a similar tone and narrative style; however, the term \"一段\" may suggest a more extended period rather than the playful, spontaneous nature of laughter typically captured by \"一阵.\"\n\n2.

The word choice difference between \"一段\" and \"一阵\" is not explicitly addressed in the Analysis, but it relates to the subtleties of idiomatic expressions and the need to convey the right nuance of interruption.\n   2.

And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antiqued in like an actual metal ornament. After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well, and just applied that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments.
