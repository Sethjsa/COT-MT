Addressing of differences in Analysis:\n\n   1. **(Word Choice)**: This is implicitly addressed when discussing \"one-line references\" and the need for potentially descriptive approaches in the analysis, but it does not specifically mention \"způsobem\" vs. \"v podobě.\"\n   \n   2. **(Phrase Structure)**: This detail is not specifically addressed in the analysis.

Syntax: Translation-1 has a single excited vowel followed by an exclamation mark, while Translation-2 includes a different combination of letters that conveys a sense of joy.\n   3.
