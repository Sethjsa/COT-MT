The difference in **word choice** is implicitly addressed in the Analysis when it mentions looking for idiomatic expressions that might not translate directly, suggesting an awareness of nuances in translations.\n   2.

    "0430 Itania time. Cohren hated waking up this early. Mainly because it was his responsibility to wake everyone else up in his company. Silently stepping out of his bunk, he put on his combat fatigues, throwing on his assault vest, and packed up his belongings from his locker, being careful with a particular small box. He shoulded his rifle and put his helmet on a small hook connected to his belt. It had all its fixing, respirator, goggles, everything needed. After checking his ammo pouches, he quietly walked out of the barracks, mud and ice squelching under his boots.": [

Addressing the differences in the analysis:\n   1. The use of \"prohlížím\" is not directly addressed in the Analysis. The Analysis mentioned the action of \"browsing\" needing to be natural and appropriate in Czech but did not specify the addition of \"teď.\"\n   2. The distinction between \"browsing Digikey\" and \"hledám součástky na Digikey\" is implicitly addressed in the analysis under the point discussing browsing for parts, but it does not detail specifically that \"on Digikey\" is rephrased.\n   3. The reflexive action of \"build myself\" is explicitly addressed in the analysis, particularly where it discusses ensuring the reflexive action is clearly conveyed (2nd bullet).\n   4. The translation of \"exact use case\" is discussed in the analysis, indicating the need to find the most appropriate term, but does not specifically note the omission of \"použití\" in Translation-2.\n   5. The term \"rovnou\" is not mentioned in the analysis, so its effect of immediacy is not covered.\n\n3.

Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally.

Jochen Kopelke, head of Germany's police union, warned in an interview with Tagesspiegel, a daily, that the farmers were probably \"just the start of an enormous wave of protest this year.\" Germany was the only big economy to shrink in 2023, and the year ended on an especially sour note, with an unexpected drop in business confidence in December.

Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.": [

Translation-2 suggests that the hedges have reached a certain size without implying ongoing growth.\n   \n   4. **Style**: \n      - Translation-1 might be viewed as more descriptive and progressive, while Translation-2 is more definitive, stating a current state.\n\n2. Addressing in the Analysis:\n\n   1. **Wording**: This aspect is not explicitly addressed in the Analysis, as it doesn't discuss specific verbs used in the translations.\n   2. **Syntax**: This difference is not explicitly addressed; the Analysis talks about naturalness but does not delve into specific grammatical aspects.\n   3. **Semantics**: The semantics of the continuous vs. completed state is not directly addressed in the Analysis, even though it suggests considering nuances.\n   4. **Style**: The style difference is implicitly acknowledged in the Analysis’s focus on achieving a natural-sounding translation, but it does not specify the stylistic choices.\n\n3.

Addressing of differences in the analysis:\n\n   1. The inclusion of \"taky\" in Translation-2 related to the humor and self-deprecation, but the analysis does not explicitly address the nuance of agreement or camaraderie added by \"taky\".

Main differences between Translation-1 and Translation-2:\n\n   1. **Phrase for \"Waking them up\"**:\n      - Translation-1: „Probudit je“ (literal interpretation).\n      - Translation-2: „Probouzíme je“ (suggests an ongoing action or collective effort).\n   \n   2. **Syntax**:\n      - Translation-1: \"Cohren se otočil a uviděl poručíka Nemice přicházet\" (uses a direct statement about Nemic).\n      - Translation-2: \"otočil se Cohren a uviděl přicházet podporučíka Nemice\" (slightly restructured with emphasis on \"Cohren turning\").\n   \n   3. **Rank of Officer**:\n      - Translation-1: Uses \"poručík Nemic\" (Lieutenant).\n      - Translation-2: Uses \"podporučík Nemice\" (Second Lieutenant or less ranked).\n\n   4. **Action Description**:\n      - Translation-1: \"přicházet\" (to come, implying movement toward).\n      - Translation-2: \"přicházet\" as well, but contextually may imply a different nuance based on the structure of the sentence.\n\n2. Analysis of how differences are addressed in the Analysis:\n\n   1. Phasing: The analysis doesn’t explicitly address the difference between “Probudit je” and “Probouzíme je”, focusing instead on the literal vs. idiomatic meaning of \"Waking them up\". It mentions that \"Waking them up\" could be literal or context-dependent, but does not delve into the nuances of verb form (ongoing vs. simple). \n\n   2. Syntax: The analysis mentions context dependence of \"walking up”, but does not address the specific syntactical difference—restructuring in Translation-2 which places emphasis differently.\n\n   3. Rank of Officer: The analysis does not mention the officer's rank differences, nor does it consider the impact of this on translation.\n\n   4. Action Description: The analysis discusses “walking up” but does not address the nuances of \"coming\" in either translation.\n\n3.

Capitalization: In Translation-2, \"Úderných jednotek\" is capitalized, while in Translation-1, \"úderných vojáků\" is in lowercase.
