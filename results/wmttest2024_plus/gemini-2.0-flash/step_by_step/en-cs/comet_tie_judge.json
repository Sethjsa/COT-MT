Addressing of differences in the Analysis:\n\n   1. The concept that \"pohánět\" and \"udržet v chodu\" might convey slightly different meanings regarding capability and performance is implicitly covered in the analysis focusing on \"on paper,\" but it does not explicitly address the specific verbs used. Therefore, this difference is partly reflected but not fully analyzed.\n   \n   2.

Count of the differences reflected in the analysis:\n   - For Translation-1: 1 difference (partially reflected).\n   - For Translation-2: 1 difference (not reflected).\n\nOverall, both translations reflect a distinct interpretation of the original text, but only one aspect of Translation-1's differences is partially reflected in the analysis.\n\n<trans-1-cnt>1</trans-1-cnt>\n<trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.

Addressing in the Analysis:\n   1. The difference regarding the phrase for \"jump right into things\" is **explicitly** addressed in the analysis: \"jump right into things\" is identified as a key idiomatic expression.
