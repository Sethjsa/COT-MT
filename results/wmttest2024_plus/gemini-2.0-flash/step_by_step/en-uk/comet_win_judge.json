The use of \"Еге ж\": This difference relates to the analysis as it addresses the tone and emphasis of the phrase. The analysis discusses the need to convey the sense of frustration or resignation, which \"Еге ж\" may capture better than \"І\". Therefore, this part is explicitly addressed in the analysis.\n   2.
