    "Thus, we had the introduction of the Cost of Living (Tenant protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 nearly 18 months ago which sought to cap rents for a limited period to ease the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis. What we find now from the latest Scottish Government statistics is that, in the last year alone, average rents have increased in all sized properties, ranging from the lowest rise of 11.7 per cent for one-bedroom to the highest figure of 14.3 per cent for two-bedroom homes. Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.": [

        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Introductory Phrase**: Translation-1 starts with \"Ось ще одна версія\", while Translation-2 uses \"Існує ще одна версія\". Translation-1 implies the presence of a new version, while Translation-2 states it more definitively.\n   2. **Verb Form**: Translation-1 uses \"розповідає\", whereas Translation-2 uses \"розповідаючи\", which is a gerund form. This affects the flow of the sentence.\n   3. **Phrase for Runtime**: Translation-1 uses \"меншою тривалістю\", while Translation-2 uses \"меншим хронометражем\". The term \"тривалість\" implies duration, while \"хронометраж\" directly relates to time measurement, which can suggest a different nuance.\n   4. **Descriptive Language for Production Values**: In Translation-1, it's \"менш шаленою вартістю виробництва\", while in Translation-2 it's \"менш божевільною вартістю виробництва\".
