You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well.

The choice of verb \"consentir\" versus \"accepter\" is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis, though the analysis does point out the need for elegance in the phrasing but does not specify this as a difference.\n   3. The use of \"au sujet de\" vs. \"sur\" is not explicitly mentioned but relates to the analysis's point about finding a more polished way of expressing \"make remarks.\"\n   4. There is no difference here, as both translations use the same phrasing for age.\n\n3.
