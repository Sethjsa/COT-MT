Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can eventually arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual.

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months.

The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market.

        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Wording:**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"Laissez-la partir !\" which directly translates to \"Let her go!\" \n      - Translation-2 introduces a completely different context with \"Partir si tôt ?\" meaning \"Leave so soon?\" which changes the subject and focus.\n   \n   2. **Syntax:**\n      - Translation-1 is structured as a command with an imperative form.\n      - Translation-2 uses a rhetorical question and does not convey a command or an imperative, altering the sentence structure.\n   \n   3. **Semantics:**\n      - Translation-1 maintains the urgency and clarity of the original text's intent.\n      - Translation-2 shifts the meaning substantially, possibly indicating surprise or regret rather than a command related to someone’s release.\n   \n   4. **Style:**\n      - Translation-1 is straightforward and adheres closely to the tone intended in the original.\n      - Translation-2 adds narrative context and character involvement, which is not present in the original phrase, changing the focus and style entirely.\n\n2. **Analysis Reflection:**\n   1. Wording difference (Translation-1 vs Translation-2) is not explicitly addressed but the analysis mentions capturing the intended meaning (a nuance that is critical in translation).\n   2. Syntax difference is not explicitly addressed but the focus on tone suggests that the structure should align with the original context.\n   3. Semantics difference is somewhat addressed since the analysis discusses the nuances of demand, pleading, or resignation which are lost in Translation-2.\n   4. Style difference is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis, yet the emphasis on the tone affects style consideration in translation.\n\n3. Count of Reflected Differences:\n   - Translation-1 has 0 differences reflected because no explicit wording, syntax, or style was discussed in the analysis.\n   - Translation-2 has 1 difference reflected, relating to semantics since the intended meaning of command is shifted.\n\n<trans-1-cnt>0</trans-1-cnt> <trans-2-cnt>1</trans-2-cnt>"
