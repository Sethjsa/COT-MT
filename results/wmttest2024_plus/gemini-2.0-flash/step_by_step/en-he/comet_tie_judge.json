        "1. Main differences between Translation-1 and Translation-2:\n   1. **Wording for \"went out\"**: Translation-1 uses \"הפסיקה לפעול\" (stopped working), while Translation-2 uses \"יצאה משימוש\" (went out of use). \n   2. **Syntax**: The phrase \"רק שעה אחת אחרי השקיעה\" (only one hour after sunset) is used in both, but the difference in verbs alters the structure and connotation slightly in each translation.\n   3. **Semantics of idiomatic expression**: \"Went out\" in the context of a camera not functioning can carry slightly different meanings. Translation-1 suggests a more active sense of malfunction, while Translation-2 suggests a complete cessation of use.\n   4. **Style**: Translation-1 feels more direct and technical, while Translation-2 reads as somewhat more formal and conceptually broader in its interpretation of \"going out\".\n\n2. Evaluation of whether the differences are addressed in the Analysis:\n   1. The difference in wording (\"went out\" to \"stopped working\" vs. \"went out of use\") is **implicitly** addressed; the analysis mentions the challenge in idiomatic expressions that may not translate directly.\n   2. The syntax difference is **not directly** addressed in the analysis.\n   3. The semantic difference regarding idiomatic usage is **implicitly** captured within the context of translation challenges; it discusses meanings and how they relate to potential difficulties in direct translation.\n   4. The style difference is **not explicitly** discussed in the analysis.\n\n3. Count of reflected differences:\n   - Translation-1: 2 differences (the wording and the semantic aspect related to idiomatic expressions).\n   - Translation-2: 0 differences are explicitly reflected.\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt> and <trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"

        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Usage of \"הייתה נוהגת\" vs. \"נהגה\":** Translation-1 uses \"הייתה נוהגת\" (was in the habit of) while Translation-2 uses \"נהגה\" (had the habit of). \n   2. **Complexity of Past Habit Expression:** Translation-1's structure makes the past habitual action more explicit by including the verb \"הייתה\" (was), while Translation-2 simplifies it.\n   3. **Punctuation:** Translation-1 includes a comma after \"יודעים את זה,\" while Translation-2 does not include punctuation there.\n   4. **Nuance of \"קל לראות\":** Although both translations use \"קל לראות\", Translation-1 has a slightly more formal feel due to the additional grammatical structure.\n\n2. **Analysis Addressing Differences:**\n   1. The difference regarding \"הייתה נוהגת\" vs. \"נהגה\" is implicitly addressed in the analysis under **\"used to\"**, where it notes the need to capture the past habit or state, but it does not specify the choice between these two forms.\n   2. The complexity of past habit expression is implicitly addressed in the analysis, again under **\"used to\"**, but it does not explicitly discuss the specific structure used in each translation.\n   3. Punctuation is not mentioned in the analysis.\n   4. The nuance of \"קל לראות\" is discussed where the analysis mentions considering phrases that convey \"obvious,\" but there is no direct reference to the difference in tone or formality between the two translations.\n\n3. **Count of Differences Reflected in the Analysis:**\n   - Differences related to Translation-1 reflected in the analysis: 2 (diffs 1 and 2).\n   - Differences related to Translation-2 reflected in the analysis: 1 (diff 4).\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt> and <trans-2-cnt>1</trans-2-cnt>"
