In Translation-1, the phrase \"ואציל סמכויות\" (and a new devolved) is used, while Translation-2 omits \"סמכויות\" (authorities), resulting in \"ואציל\" (and should, or and will). \n   2. Translation-1 includes the word \"צפוי\" (expected), whereas Translation-2 does not include this word before \"שיאיץ\" (will accelerate), which makes the second translation less certain about the impact of the tax.\n   3. The phrase \"תוליים\" (virgin) appears in both translations, but the context created by the preceding clauses differs slightly between the two translations due to the omitted context word \"צפוי\" in Translation-2.\n\n2. **Relation to Analysis:**\n   1. The phrase \"ואציל סמכויות\" is an implicit reflection as the analysis highlights the need for careful word choice for \"bring in\" and \"devolved,\" but does not explicitly mention savvy wording regarding \"סמכויות.\"\n   2. The word \"צפוי\" is implicitly addressed in the analysis where it mentions crafting an accurate translation that captures the nuances, suggesting a need for appropriate terms. \n   3. The difference regarding \"תוליים\" is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis, but it indirectly refers to needing accurate translations of \"virgin products.\"\n\n3.

Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well.

        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Translation of \"levels\":** \n      - Translation-1 uses \"שלבים\" (Shlavim) while Translation-2 uses \"שלבים\" (Shlavim) which are the same, but the lack of discussion about this term in the analysis means it’s not addressed there directly.\n   2. **Translation of \"haven't been cleared\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"שלא סיימו אותם\" (SheLo Siimu Otam) meaning \"that haven't been completed\" while Translation-2 uses \"שלא נוצחו\" (SheLo Nitzachu) meaning \"that haven't been defeated.\" This difference in wording and meaning addresses the completion aspect differently. This distinction is not specifically mentioned in the analysis.\n   3. **Translation of \"Super Mario Maker\":**\n      - Translation-1 keeps \"Super Mario Maker\" in English and uses \"המקורי\" (HaMikori) afterwards, while Translation-2 transliterates it to \"סופר מריו מייקר\" (Super Mario Maker). This choice is a stylistic one that prioritizes Hebrew readability. The analysis only notes the English term being used without discussing transliteration.\n   4. **Use of laughter abbreviation:**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"חח\" (khakh) while Translation-2 uses \"חחח\" (khakhakh), which reflects a different level of laughter intensity. The analysis mentions the abbreviation but does not address different forms or intensities of this laughter.\n\n2. **Addressing in the Analysis:**\n   1. The term \"levels\" is not explicitly or implicitly addressed in the analysis.\n   2. The phrase \"haven't been cleared\" is addressed indirectly when discussing idiomatic expressions, as it mentions the need for clarification in translation but does not specifically analyze the chosen wording comparison.\n   3. The use of \"Super Mario Maker\" is discussed in terms of its original presentation (in English) but does not address the difference in transliteration versus original use.\n   4. The laughter abbreviation is mentioned, but the difference in intensity (between \"חח\" and \"חחח\") is not discussed.\n\n3.

Explicitly or implicitly addressed in the Analysis:\n   - Difference 1 (Interjection for disgust): Yes, explicitly addressed under \"Blech.\"\n   - Difference 2 (Conversational filler): Yes, explicitly addressed under \"Okay, so...\"\n   - Difference 3 (\"So\" in the phrase): Yes, explicitly addressed under \"Okay, so...\"\n   - Difference 4 (Style and tone): No, this difference is more a matter of nuance and tone which was not directly addressed in the analysis.\n\n3.

Addressing of Differences in the Analysis:\n\n   1. **Difference 1**: The use of personal vs. collective perspective is implicitly addressed in the analysis regarding translation challenges.

The difference in **wording** (gerund vs. present tense) is implicitly addressed by stating, \"This is the gerund form of 'to find,'\" in the analysis for Translation-1.\n   2. The difference in **syntax** (emphasis on an ongoing process vs. current action) is implicitly present in the discussion of “Finding an alternative” in the context analysis but not directly compared.\n   3. The difference in **semantics** is implicitly addressed as well; the analysis remarks on the challenge of finding the most natural phrasing in Hebrew, which implies consideration of how \"shortly\" applies to the act.\n   4. The difference in **style** is not explicitly addressed in the analysis. It focuses more on the adequacy and directness of translation rather than stylistic nuances.\n\n3.

Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally.

The analysis implies that the adverb \"never\" in Translation-2 poses challenges compared to \"always\" in Translation-1.\n\n   3. **Verb Choice**: \n      - Implicitly addressed, since the analysis considers the challenge of direct translations and suggests that \"hard\" and \"easy\" have different implications.\n\n   4. **Syntax**: \n      - Implicitly addressed, as the analysis indicates that direct translations may become awkward, hinting at potential syntax issues.\n\n   5. **Semantics**: \n      - Implicitly addressed, as the analysis suggests a focus on identifying nuances in meaning that may change with different translations.\n\n3. Count of differences reflected in the analysis:\n   - Related to Translation-1: 3 differences (1, 3, 4)\n   - Related to Translation-2: 2 differences (2, 5)\n\n4.

Translation-1 uses the verb in the participial form suggesting an ongoing action (\"נערך\"), whereas Translation-2 uses the perfect participle that indicates a completed action (\"ערוך\").\n   \n   3. **Semantics:**\n      - The semantic nuances differ; \"נערך\" implies the action of editing is completed but still resonant with activity, whereas \"ערוך\" conveys a finished state more definitively.\n\n   4. **Style:**\n      - Translation-1 may convey a more engaging tone with the use of \"נערך,\" suggesting the process of editing, while Translation-2 seems to present the information in a more straightforward manner with a focus on the result.\n\n2. **Explicit or Implicit Addressing in Analysis:**\n\n   1. The difference in wording related to “נערך” vs. “ערוך” is implicitly addressed through the analysis of the idiomatic expression \"On the plus side,\" which discusses finding an equivalent that fits contextually, but does not specifically mention verb form usage. \n   \n   2. The difference in syntax is implicit in the analysis, as it touches on the naturalness and appropriateness of expressions, but does not analyze specific syntactical structures.\n   \n   3. The semantic difference is implicit since the analysis notes the importance of conveying the positive aspect, which indirectly relates to the subtle meanings of \"edited.\"\n   \n   4.

Addressing differences in the analysis:\n   - The differences in wording and semantics are implicitly addressed in the analysis as the focus is on identifying potentially problematic idiomatic expressions. Referring to idiomatic expressions could suggest that terms like \"cap\" (תקרה) versus \"restriction\" (הגבלה) may have different implications that could affect comprehension.\n   - The issue of clarity and audience understanding is not explicitly addressed in the analysis but is a relevant consideration when discussing potential problems in translation.\n\n3.

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months.

The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market.
