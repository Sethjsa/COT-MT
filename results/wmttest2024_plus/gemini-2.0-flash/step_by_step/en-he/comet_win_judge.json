Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants.

Translation-2 makes it more of a supporting detail.\n   3. **Clarity and Flow**: Translation-2 may read slightly more naturally in Hebrew due to the more standard syntax of presenting the subject \"מזג האוויר\" (the weather) followed by the action (\"לא שיתף פעולה\") and then the time (\"בשבוע שעבר\").\n   4. **Usage of \"אז\"**: The usage of \"אז\" (so) is consistent in both translations, but in Translation-1, the separation of \"אז\" with a subsequent action may imply a direct consequence more clearly than in Translation-2.\n\n2.
