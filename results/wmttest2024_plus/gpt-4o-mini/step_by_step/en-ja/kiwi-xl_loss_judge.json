The former is a more casual form, and the latter is more formal or polite.\n   2. **Time reference phrase**: Translation-1 says \"これまでのところ\" (kore made no tokoro), which translates to \"so far,” while Translation-2 uses \"今のところ\" (ima no tokoro), which also means \"for now\" or \"at this moment.\" Both phrases are acceptable, but \"今のところ\" has a slightly more immediate connotation.\n   3. **Distance measurement articulation**: Translation-1 states \"平日あたり5キロちょっとの平均\" (heijitsu atari 5 kilo chotto no heikin), whereas Translation-2 uses \"平日に平均で5K少し超えています\" (heijitsu ni heikin de 5K sukoshi koeteimasu). The difference here is in how the distance is framed; Translation-2 uses \"5K\" directly while Translation-1 translates it to \"5キロ\" (5 kilometers).\n   4. **Word order and inclusion of \"で\"**: Translation-1 has a simpler structure and states \"ERGで\" while Translation-2 elaborates by stating \"いろいろな方法で分けています\" (iroiro na hōhō de wakete imasu) before ending with “ERGで,” which gives a more complete impression of the action occurring in ERG.\n\n2.

So this is the Knagglig crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just E6000ed these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to.

Main Differences:\n   1. **Word Choice for \"leeching off\"**: \n      - Translation-1 uses \"甘えて利用しています\" (amaete riyō shiteimasu) while Translation-2 simply uses \"利用しています\" (riyō shiteimasu), omitting the nuance of reliance or taking advantage.\n   2. **Syntax and Structure**: \n      - Translation-1 starts with \"家の中にすでに巣がある箱は\" (the box that already has a nest in the house), emphasizing the location of the nest. Translation-2 reorders this to \"巣がすでにある箱は、家のWi-Fiを利用しています\" (the box that has a nest already utilizes the house's Wi-Fi), which is more direct and less descriptive of the nest's location.\n   3. **Inclusion of \"家の中に\" (inside the house)**: \n      - Translation-1 specifies \"家の中に\" (inside the house), while Translation-2 simplifies it to just \"家のWi-Fi\" (the house's Wi-Fi), potentially losing some specificity about the location of the nest.\n   4. **Use of \"Wifi\" vs. \"Wi-Fi\"**: \n      - Translation-1 uses \"Wifi\" while Translation-2 uses the more accurate \"Wi-Fi\" with a hyphen, adhering more closely to standard terminology.\n\n2. Analysis Addressing the Differences:\n   1. The nuance of \"leeching off\" is explicitly addressed in the Analysis under “Leeching off,” where it discusses the use of phrases that convey taking advantage or relying on.\n   2. The emphasis on structure and flow is implicitly addressed in the Analysis under the \"General Tone and Structure\" section, where it mentions the indirect phrasing in Japanese.\n   3. The direct translation and localization of terms is not specifically addressed for \"家の中に\" vs. \"家のWi-Fi\" in the analysis, nor the Wi-Fi terminology.\n   4. The change in specificity regarding \"巣\" (nest) is also not discussed in the analysis.\n\n3.

    "The cold, rainy night ensued my long overdue walk–exploring the city of Paltricus was a privilege to those who’d been safe from the mutation via escape, or pure luck. The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years. It must be lonely in the great distant sky. Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living. Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat. The mineral that appeased technology, and architecture was a great mineral that extended our foundation of life. Public knowledge only knows so much about this mineral though, mainly because mainly because it’s kept under pretty tough wraps.": [

Translation-1 uses \"長い間待ち望んでいた散歩\" (long-awaited walk) while Translation-2 uses \"遅ればせながらの散策\" (late walk), which conveys different nuances about the timing.\n   2. In Translation-1, \"突然変異から免れた者たち\" (those who escaped from the mutation) contrasts with Translation-2's \"運良く突然変異から免れたりした人々\" (people who escaped the mutation by luck), emphasizing the role of luck more explicitly in Translation-2.\n   3. Translation-1 has \"何千年も変わらない鮮やかな星々\" (vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years) compared to Translation-2's \"何千年も輝き続ける活気ある星々\" (vibrant stars shining for thousands of years), changing the focus from static to active.\n   4. The phrase \"満杯で\" (filled to the brim) in Translation-1 is replaced by \"溢れかえっており\" (overflowing) in Translation-2, which alters the implication from being full to being excessively crowded.\n   5. Translation-1 uses \"傑出している\" (to be great) while Translation-2 uses \"誇っていました\" (boast of), changing the tone from admiration to an assertion of height.\n   6. The mineral is referred to as \"イグニアット\" in Translation-1, while Translation-2 spells it as \"イグニニア,\" introducing inconsistency in nomenclature.\n   7. Translation-1 states \"公に知られていることは限られており\" (publicly known is limited), while Translation-2 presents it as \"公共の知識はあまり多くを知りません\" (public knowledge doesn't know much), altering tone from factual to conversational.\n   8. The phrase “厳重に秘密にされているためだ” (kept under tough wraps) in Translation-1 is rephrased to “それが厳重に隠されているからです” (it is kept strictly hidden) in Translation-2, slightly changing the nuance of how the secretive aspect is depicted.\n\n2. **Addressed in the Analysis**: \n   1. Difference 1 (long-awaited walk) is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis.\n   2. Difference 2 (emphasis on luck) is implicitly addressed as the analysis suggests clarifying the meaning of \"mutation\" and emphasizes fortune, but does not explicitly compare translations.\n   3.
