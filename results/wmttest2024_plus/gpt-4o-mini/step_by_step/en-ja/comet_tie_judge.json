    "Thus, we had the introduction of the Cost of Living (Tenant protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 nearly 18 months ago which sought to cap rents for a limited period to ease the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis. What we find now from the latest Scottish Government statistics is that, in the last year alone, average rents have increased in all sized properties, ranging from the lowest rise of 11.7 per cent for one-bedroom to the highest figure of 14.3 per cent for two-bedroom homes. Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.": [

    "With digital tools, it is easier than ever to create, edit, and publish your work to the world. But there's a cost. It's also easier than ever to spread misinformation, and fake news has become a real issue in recent times. We see this with students. According to a Stanford study, only 25% of high school students were able to identify an accurate news story compared to a fake one. Students also had a hard time distinguishing between real and fake photographs, as well as authentic and staged videos.": [
        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Phrase for \"easier than ever\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"これまで以上に簡単に\" while Translation-2 uses \"これまでになく簡単になりました\".\n   2. **\"cost\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"代償があります\", while Translation-2 states \"代償もあります.\"\n   3. **\"fake news\" vs. \"fake information\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"偽情報\" while Translation-2 uses \"偽ニュース\".\n   4. **\"we see this with students\":**\n      - Translation-1 states \"私たちは学生の例からこのことがわかります,\" whereas Translation-2 uses \"これが学生にも見られます.\"\n   5. **Phrase for \"distinguishing\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"見分けられる\" and \"見分けるのに苦労していました\", while Translation-2 uses \"区別できた\" and \"区別することにも苦労していました.\"\n   6. **\"staged videos\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"演出された動画\", while Translation-2 combines it with \"staged\" rendered in English and adds the Japanese \"動画\" after it.\n\n2. **Analysis Addressing the Differences:**\n   1. Explicitly addressed (\"easier than ever\"): \"これまで以上に簡単に\" is discussed in point 2.\n   2. Implicitly addressed (\"cost\"): \"コスト\" is mentioned, but \"代償もあります\" is not explicitly stated.\n   3. Not addressed (\"fake news\"): \"偽情報” versus \"偽ニュース\" is not addressed.\n   4. Explicitly addressed (\"we see this with students\"): The analysis mentions \"私たちは学生の例からこのことがわかります,\" but does not capture the tone variation.\n   5. Partially addressed (\"distinguishing\"): Both phrases around distinguishing are covered to some degree but not in detail regarding the specific verbs.\n   6. Not directly addressed (\"staged videos\"): The analysis discusses \"staged videos\" but does not detail this specific rendering.\n\n3. **Reflection Count:**\n   - Differences related to Translation-1 that are reflected in the analysis: 3 (1, 4, 5)\n   - Differences related to Translation-2 that are reflected in the analysis: 2 (1, 4)\n\n<trans-1-cnt>3</trans-1-cnt> <trans-2-cnt>2</trans-2-cnt>"

    "Up ahead, Nyssi was clinging on for dear life as Thassalin flailed around, blasting the blackened monster with bursts of flame. While the creature was definitely injured, it seemed very pissed off and unwilling to back off, and the fire balls didn't seem to be doing as much as they should. As Thassalin straightened himself out though, Nyssi took this as an opportunity to pull out her own weapon, a trusty shotgun. Sure, it wasn't meant for this sort of thing, but surely the scattershot would at least deter the black beast?": [
