    "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Disagree! If the enemy of your enemy were your friend, he'd explicitly be your friend. You know, oftentimes people can work together for a time, united by their dislike for something or someone. But if that relationship was conceived by your mutual dislike for whatever that thing is, what's to stop that relationship from dissolving or becoming hostile after that thing is taken care of? Like, the foundation of a friendship is much more stable than that. But, you know, I also understand the short-term strategy behind it, so I'll just disagree.": [
        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. Translation-1 uses \"האווירה של האויב של האויב שלי היא הידיד שלי\" while Translation-2 uses \"האויב של האויב שלי הוא חבר שלי.\" The first translation incorrectly translates 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' to suggest an atmosphere or environment rather than a direct statement about the enemy's relationship.\n   2. In Translation-1, \"בדרך מפורש\" is used, while Translation-2 has \"במפורש\" for \"explicitly.\" The first translation adds an unnecessary word ('באופן') which makes it less fluent.\n   3. Translation-1 uses \"דחייה\" for dislike, while Translation-2 uses \"חוסר החיבה\" which translates as 'lack of liking.' The first translation is more direct while the second is slightly more formal.\n   4. In Translation-1, the phrase \"כשהטיפול בו\" is rendered as \"אחרי שדבר זה טופל,\" whereas in Translation-2 it's \"אחר שדברים מסוימים יטופלו.\" The second translation is more specific, indicating 'certain things' rather than 'that thing.'\n   5. The term \"הכנה של חברות\" in Translation-1 is changed to \"היסוד של חברות\" in Translation-2. This changes the metaphor from 'preparation' to 'foundation', aligning with the original text more closely.\n   6. \"עוין\" is used in both translations, but Translation-1 uses \"להפוך לעויין,\" which is a slight grammatical discrepancy compared to the more fluid structure found in Translation-2.\n   7. The phrase \"לחברות\" in Translation-1 is shifted to \"לאסטרטגיה לטווח הקצר\" in Translation-2 which presents a clearer interpretation of the context regarding the 'short-term strategy.'\n\n2. **Addressed in Analysis:**\n   1. The difference regarding the phrase about \"the enemy\" is implicitly addressed by discussing the lack of a direct equivalent in Hebrew (paraphrasing).\n   2. The issue with \"explicitly be your friend\" is explicitly addressed in the analysis, noting the need for clarity.\n   3. The use of \"united by their dislike\" is explicitly discussed in the analysis, mentioning possible improvements.\n   4. The idea of \"dissolving\" relationships is also explicitly addressed, pointing out the need for idiomatic translations.\n   5. The difference in metaphor about \"foundation of a friendship\" is explicitly mentioned in the analysis.\n   6. The grammatical differences concerning structure and fluency are not explicitly addressed in the analysis.\n   7. The term \"short-term strategy\" is explicitly mentioned and the need for clearer phrasing is noted in regards to relationships.\n\n3.

The former is more feminine, while the latter is more neutral.\n   2. **\"It’s just a phase\"**: Translation-1 uses \"זה סתם שלב\", while Translation-2 uses \"זה רק שלב\". The word \"רק\" implies emphasis on something being mere or simple, while \"סתם\" can imply something trivial. \n   3. **Pronoun (Addressing Gender)**: Translation-1 uses \"את\" (feminine) while Translation-2 uses \"אתה\" (masculine).\n   4. **\"grow out of it\" Translation**: Translation-1 uses \"את תגדלי מזה\", whereas Translation-2 uses \"אתה תתעבר מזה\". \"תתעבר\" generally means \"to become pregnant\", which is not a direct equivalent; \"את תגדלי מזה\" captures the intended meaning more accurately.\n   5. **\"slurring his words\" Translation**: Translation-1 uses \"מגמגם את המילים שלו\", while Translation-2 uses \"עם דיבור מעורפל\". The latter is a broader term that implies unclear speech rather than specifically slurring words.\n   6. **Introductory Phrasing**: Translation-1 has \"הנסיך לא חשב על זה\", while Translation-2 has \"הנסיך לא חשב כך\", where \"על זה\" and \"כך\" imply different nuances in what he was thinking about.\n\n2. **Relevance in Analysis**:\n   1.

So I went in with ginger first. I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antiqued in like an actual metal ornament. After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well, and just applied that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments.
