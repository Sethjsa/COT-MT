The first translation emphasizes \"מעל\" (above) and \"נמצא\" (is found), while the second emphasizes \"בעליון\" (on top) and \"יש\" (there is).\n   2. **Phrase for the camera lens**: Translation-1 uses \"עדשת עינית דג\" (fisheye lens), while Translation-2 uses \"עין דג\" (fisheye), simplifying the term.\n   3. **IR LED terminology**: Translation-1 uses \"LED אינפרא אדום\" while Translation-2 uses \"פנס IR\".

        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **\"עבודה ביתית מהירה\" vs \"עבודת תיקון\"**: Translation-1 uses \"עבודה ביתית מהירה\" (quick home DIY), while Translation-2 uses \"עבודת תיקון\" (repair work). \n   2. **\"לחצוב\" vs \"לחץ\"**: Translation-1 uses \"לחצוב\" (to chisel), whereas Translation-2 uses \"לחזוך\" (to cut), with \"חתוך\" being more general.\n   3. **\"חציבות\" vs \"שופין\"**: Translation-1 uses \"חציבות\" (chisel) and mentions \"מסור טנון/חציבות,\" while Translation-2 uses \"שופין\" (chisel) in the context of \"מסור טנון/שופין,\" potentially making a slight shift in terminology.\n   4. **\"חלק התחתון\" vs \"החלקים התחתונים\"**: Translation-1 uses \"חלק התחתון\" (the bottom part), while Translation-2 uses \"החלקים התחתונים\" (the bottom sections), indicating a subtle change from singular to plural.\n   5. **\"מתאים בזהירות\" vs \"תשתלב בצורה מסודרת\"**: Translation-1 uses \"מתאים בזהירות\" (fit cautiously), while Translation-2 uses \"תשתלב בצורה מסודרת\" (integrate in an orderly fashion), which changes the nuance from careful fitting to a precise integration.\n\n2. **Analysis Reflection:**\n   1. The usage of \"עבודה ביתית מהירה\" in Translation-1 aligns with \"Quick bit of evening DIY\" mentioned in the analysis, but \"עבודת תיקון\" in Translation-2 does not have a direct correspondence in the analysis.\n   2. \"לחצוב\" as a translation reflects the analysis of \"chisel out\"; thus, it is addressed in the analysis.\n   3. The terminology \"חציבות\" and \"שופין\" is indirectly related to the analysis as it discusses needing appropriate terms for chiseling, which is a nuanced point in translation.\n   4. The shift from singular to plural (\"חלק\" vs \"חלקים\") does not address any explicit point in the analysis, making it an implicit difference.\n   5.
