What is there to excavate if Cosa is originally a Roman site? Was the Pantheon in Rome excavated? No, the Pantheon is even at the same ground level as the surrounding, contemporary buildings. And why is that? Because the Pantheon was probably built during the Roman era. It is also almost cardinally oriented, which indicates that it cannot be very ancient.": [

The difference regarding \"wash plants\" vs. \"заводи з обробки\" is implicitly addressed by the mention of \"terminology specific to recycling\" indicating the need for accurate terminology, but not specifically.\n   2.
