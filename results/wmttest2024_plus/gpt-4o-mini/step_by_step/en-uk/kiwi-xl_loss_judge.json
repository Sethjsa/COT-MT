This changes the imagery and understanding of Kayel's position concerning the monster.\n   \n   5. **\"—Ç–∞\" vs \"—ñ\"** - Translation-1 uses \"—ñ\" (and) while Translation-2 uses \"—Ç–∞\" (and). This is a stylistic difference that can affect the fluidity of the sentence but does not impact the meaning significantly.\n\n2. Analysis relevance:\n\n   1. The discussion about \"filled the air\" in the analysis addresses the different approaches taken in both translations. The analysis calls for careful consideration of metaphorical phrases, but does not explicitly discuss the term \"—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ\" or the description of the sound as \"–ø—ñ—Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–π,\" which could be considered a semantic oversight in Translation-2.\n   \n   2. The choice between \"—Ä–æ–∑—Å—ñ—é–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—è\" and \"—Ä–æ–∑–≤—ñ—è–ª–∞—Å—å\" is relevant to the analysis because it emphasizes capturing the imagery and emotional aspects of the phrase \"the darkness all around them dissipated.\" However, the analysis does not clarify which verb would be more suitable, leaving open the choice.\n   \n   3. The difference between \"–≤—ñ–¥–∫—Ä–∏–≤–∞—é—á–∏\" and \"–≤–∏—è–≤–ª—è—é—á–∏\" reflects the analysis note concerning translating the revealing action. The analysis states the importance of carefully addressing these phrases but does not favor one term over another explicitly.\n   \n   4. The difference regarding \"–Ω–∞ —Å–ø–∏–Ω—ñ\" vs \"–Ω–∞ –≤–µ—Ä—à–∏–Ω—ñ\" directly relates to the analysis on the vivid depiction of actions like \"collapsed on the ground,\" and how translations should capture the nature of movement and positioning.\n   \n   5. The difference regarding \"—ñ\" vs \"—Ç–∞\" has no mention in the analysis, as it focuses primarily on semantic and illustrative choices rather than conjunction usage.\n\n3.

        "1. **Differences between Translation-1 and Translation-2:**\n   1. **Word choice for \"non magical\":** \n      - Translation-1 uses \"–Ω–µ–∫ magical\" which is incorrect and mixes languages, while Translation-2 uses \"–Ω–µ–º–∞–≥—ñ—á–Ω–µ\", which is the correct Ukrainian term.\n   2. **Phrase for \"split in two\":** \n      - Translation-1 uses \"–ø–æ–¥—ñ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –¥–≤—ñ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∏\" while Translation-2 uses \"–¥—ñ–ª–∏–≤—Å—è –Ω–∞ –¥–≤—ñ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∏\". The former suggests a static state while the latter implies action, which is more dynamic.\n   3. **Conjunction choice:** \n      - Translation-1 uses \"—ñ\" while Translation-2 uses \"—Ç–∞\" as the conjunction between \"–ü—ñ–≤–Ω—ñ—á\" and \"–ü—ñ–≤–¥–µ–Ω—å\". \"–¢–∞\" is more commonly used in literary Ukrainian to connect clauses in this context.\n   4. **Phrase for \"displays of power\":**\n      - Translation-1 uses \"–≤–∏—è–≤–∞–º–∏ —Å–∏–ª–∏\" while Translation-2 opts for \"–ø—Ä–æ—è–≤—ñ–≤ —Å–∏–ª–∏\". The latter is a more idiomatic expression in Ukrainian.\n   5. **Punctuation and formatting differences:**\n      - Translation-1 uses commas where necessary, while Translation-2 incorporates dashes for emphasis, especially between phrases (e.g., \"–ù–∞ –ü—ñ–≤–Ω–æ—á—ñ - –Ω–µ–º–∞–≥—ñ—á–Ω–µ –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª—ñ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ\"). This impacts the style and flow of the translation.\n    \n2. **Analysis Reflection:**\n   1. The incorrect term \"–Ω–µ–∫ magical\" in Translation-1 is not addressed in the analysis.\n   2. The division expressions \"–ø–æ–¥—ñ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π\" vs \"–¥—ñ–ª–∏–≤—Å—è\" is implicitly addressed in the analysis, as it discusses ‚Äúsplit in two‚Äù and suggests a smoother expression.\n   3. The conjunctions \"—ñ\" vs \"—Ç–∞\" are not directly mentioned in the analysis.\n   4. The expression of \"displays of power\" is discussed in the analysis, with a focus on capturing the meaning idiomatically, making the use of \"–ø—Ä–æ—è–≤—ñ–≤\" more relevant to the analysis.\n   5. Punctuation and formatting differences are not addressed in the analysis.\n\n3. **Count of differences reflected in the analysis:**\n   - Differences related to Translation-1: 0\n   - Differences related to Translation-2: 2 (the phrase for \"split in two\" and \"displays of power\")\n\n<trans-1-cnt>0</trans-1-cnt> and <trans-2-cnt>2</trans-2-cnt>"

    "Hey Psych2Goers, and welcome back to our channel. Thank you so much for all the love you've given us. Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now let's continue. We've all done something self-destructive at some point in our lives. Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can eventually arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual. So, here are seven common behaviors of a self-destructive person.": [

This changes the connotation from an affectionate tone to one more centered on tenderness.\n\n4. **Style**:\n   - Translation-1 has a more affectionate and warm tone with the use of multiple terms of endearment, while Translation-2 has a softer and less varied tone due to the use of fewer endearing expressions.\n\n### Analysis of Differences:\n\n1. The difference in **wording** is implicitly addressed in the analysis where terms of endearment in Ukrainian are discussed, specifically the suggestion of using \"–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥—ñ\" and \"–º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—á–∫–∞\" for \"lovelies.\" The gentleness is also captured in the proposed \"–¥–æ–±—Ä–µ–Ω—å–∫—ñ, –º–∏–ª—ñ.\" \n\n2. The difference in **syntax** is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis, although it might be a result of rephrasing.\n\n3. The difference in **semantics** is partially addressed in the analysis, as it mentions the need to maintain the affectionate tone but does not go into detail on the exact nature of \"gentle\" versus \"endearment.\"\n\n4. The **style** difference is not explicitly stated in the analysis, even though it hints at needing to preserve sentiment, the precise tone variations are not discussed.\n\n### Summary of Reflection Counts:\n\n- Differences related to Translation-1 that are reflected in the analysis: 2 (wording and semantics).\n- Differences related to Translation-2 that are reflected in the analysis: 0.\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt> and <trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"

Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well.

        "1. Main differences between Translation-1 and Translation-2:\n   1. **Pronoun and Formality**: Translation-1 uses the informal \"—Ç–∏\" and ‚Äú—è –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–µ—Å–ª–∞‚Äù while Translation-2 uses the formal \"–≤–∏\" and ‚Äú—è –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—ñ—Å‚Äù.\n   2. **Character Name**: Translation-1 uses \"–Ü–≤–æ—Ä—ñ\" while Translation-2 uses \"–ê–π–≤–æ—Ä\".\n   3. **Description of the princess**: Translation-1 uses \"–º–æ–≤—á–∞–∑–Ω–æ—ó\" while Translation-2 uses \"—Ç–∏—Ö–æ—ó\" for describing the princess.\n   4. **Action of Tapping**: Translation-1 uses \"–±–∞–≥–∞—Ç–æ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É–∫—É–≤–∞–ª–∞\" whereas Translation-2 uses \"—Å—Ç—É–∫–∞–ª–∞ –Ω–æ–≥–∞–º–∏\", which is more specific.\n   5. **Movement of Pigtails**: Translation-1 states ‚Äú–º–∞—Ö–∞–ª–∏ –≤–ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥-–Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥‚Äù, while Translation-2 uses ‚Äú—Ä–æ–∑–≥–æ–π–¥—É–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—è —Ç—É–¥–∏-—Å—é–¥–∏‚Äù.\n   6. **Reaction to Princess's Interest**: Translation-1 states \"–±—É–ª–∞ –∑–∞—Ö–æ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∞\" while Translation-2 uses \"–ø—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ –∑–∞—Ü—ñ–∫–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞\", which has a slightly different connotation.\n   7. **Request Context**: Translation-1 phrases it as \"–ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–æ —â–æ—Å—å, —â–æ –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–æ—Å—É–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—è\" while Translation-2 uses \"–ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ —â–æ—Å—å, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–≤'—è–∑–∞–Ω–µ –∑ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞–º–∏\". The structure is slightly more concise in Translation-2.\n   8. **Complex endings**: Translation-1 says \"–±—É–ª–æ –ø–æ–∑–∞ —ó—ó –∫—ñ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–æ—é\" whereas Translation-2 uses \"–≤–∏—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ –∑–∞ –º–µ–∂—ñ —ó—ó –∫—ñ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–∏\", which might carry different nuances.\n\n2.

This difference is explicitly addressed in the analysis where it suggests, \"A possible translation could convey the meaning instead of direct translation,\" thus indicating that a more accurate expression might be preferred in context.\n   2. This difference regarding the technical term \"updating\" is explicitly addressed in the analysis, where it suggests the need for a specific technical translation. \n   3. The difference in syntax and style is implicitly addressed by the suggestion to maintain the informal tone in the analysis, but it does not directly state that \"–∑–º—ñ–Ω—é—é\" is more formal than \"–æ–Ω–æ–≤–ª—é—é.\"\n\n3. **Count of Reflections in Analysis:**\n   - Differences related to Translation-1: 2 (the return phrase and the formal tone).\n   - Differences related to Translation-2: 2 (the informal tone and the technical term used).\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt> <trans-2-cnt>2</trans-2-cnt>"
