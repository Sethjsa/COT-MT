Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?": [

Addressing of differences in the Analysis:\n   1. **Wording of \"ready\"**: Addressed explicitly in the analysis with suggestions like \"готові до\" or \"підготовлені для.\"\n   2. **Preposition used with \"next week\"**: Although the analysis mentions \"next week\" is straightforward, it does not address the specific syntactical choice of prepositions used in both translations. Thus, this is not explicitly addressed.\n   3. **Article usage and gender agreement**: This is not explicitly addressed in the analysis as it focuses on the term \"plasterer\" and does not discuss subject agreement.\n   4. **Syntactical Structure**: This is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis but relates to the overall flow of the sentence. \n\n3.

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.
