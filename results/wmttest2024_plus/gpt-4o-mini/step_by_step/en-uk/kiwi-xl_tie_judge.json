So this is the Knagglig crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just E6000ed these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to.
