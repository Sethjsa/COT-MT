    "About 450 million years ago, plants took a giant leap out of the oceans onto the land to become the plants that we know and love today. But how did they survive? Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?": [

    "Affordable furniture DIYs are always a hit here on Lone Fox, so I wanted to share with you guys how I created this nightstand from a simple crate from IKEA. So this is the Knagglig crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just E6000ed these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to. And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand.": [

The analysis mentions that understanding the subject matter is crucial for translation, which implies recognizing the differences in wording (though it does not directly cite \"Zelle\" vs. \"Handy\").\n   - **Difference 2 (Specificity)**: This is implicitly addressed in the analysis's emphasis on understanding context for accurate translations (e.g., referring to \"the type of panel\").

Translation-2 omits \"es,\" resulting in a more streamlined but less specific phrasing.\n   3. **Clarity of Subject**: Translation-1 is slightly clearer as it refers directly to the speaker's obligation to know better as it mentions \"es,\" whereas Translation-2 is more implicit.\n   4. **Tense Modality**: Translation-1 suggests more certainty with the use of \"wissen m√ºssen,\" indicating a stronger sense of regret or necessity. Translation-2, with \"wissen sollen,\" feels more hypothetical or suggestive.\n\n2. **Analysis Reflection**:\n   1. The verb choice difference is implicitly addressed in point 2 of the Analysis, which discusses the potential translations and the idea of capturing emotional weight.\n   2.

The informal tone is explicitly addressed in the analysis regarding the phrase \"Mal sehen,\" which is suggested to maintain casualness.

The phrase \"Die Hinweise verdichten sich\" is explicitly mentioned in the analysis as a possible improvement: \"so we might need to consider a more natural-sounding expression in German, such as 'Die Hinweise verdichten sich.'\"\n   2. The phrase \"die viel glaubw√ºrdigere These unterst√ºtzen\" is also discussed in the analysis as a smoother translation than \"unterst√ºtzen die viel logischere Behauptung.\"\n   3. The analysis addresses the nuance of \"gestohlen\" in \"ist von verschiedenen, moderneren Zivilisationen entwendet worden,\" emphasizing metaphorical theft.\n   4. \"Verdeutlichen\" is not discussed, but the choice of words is noted as needing context, indicating a broader stylistic concern rather than an explicit difference.\n   5. The point on \"aktiv unterdr√ºckt, beraubt\" is referred to as requiring rephrasing: \"we could opt for 'wird aktiv unterdr√ºckt, beraubt, ausgebeutet und verborgen.'\"\n   6. The discussion on \"Danke f√ºrs Zuschauen, Leute\" supports the note regarding conversational tone adjustments, but it does not explicitly differentiate between \"Vielen Dank\" and \"Danke.\"\n   7.

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.
