    "About 450 million years ago, plants took a giant leap out of the oceans onto the land to become the plants that we know and love today. But how did they survive? Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants.

So this is the Knagglig crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just E6000ed these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to. And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand.": [

Translation-2 omits \"es,\" resulting in a more streamlined but less specific phrasing.\n   3. **Clarity of Subject**: Translation-1 is slightly clearer as it refers directly to the speaker's obligation to know better as it mentions \"es,\" whereas Translation-2 is more implicit.\n   4. **Tense Modality**: Translation-1 suggests more certainty with the use of \"wissen müssen,\" indicating a stronger sense of regret or necessity. Translation-2, with \"wissen sollen,\" feels more hypothetical or suggestive.\n\n2. **Analysis Reflection**:\n   1. The verb choice difference is implicitly addressed in point 2 of the Analysis, which discusses the potential translations and the idea of capturing emotional weight.\n   2.

The difference in wording (\"I guess\") is implicitly addressed as \"Ich denke\" may not fully capture the casual tone of \"I guess\" as discussed in the analysis. (See: \"Possible German equivalents... may not carry exactly the same casual tone.\")\n   2. The informal tone is explicitly addressed in the analysis regarding the phrase \"Mal sehen,\" which is suggested to maintain casualness. (See: \"Using expressions like 'Mal sehen' will effectively capture the casualness...\")\n   3. The future conditionality is implicitly addressed, as the analysis discusses alternative expressions for \"I'll see,\" noting that \"Ich werde sehen\" could seem too formal. (See: \"The direct translation 'Ich werde sehen' can be literal but might sound too formal.\")\n   4. The structure is not explicitly addressed in the analysis, which focuses more on idiomatic expressions and tone rather than syntactic differences.\n\n3. **Count of Reflected Differences:**\n   - Differences related to Translation-1 reflected in the analysis: 1 (the informal tone).\n   - Differences related to Translation-2 reflected in the analysis: 2 (wording and future conditionality).\n\n<trans-1-cnt>1</trans-1-cnt> \n<trans-2-cnt>2</trans-2-cnt>"

Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.": [
