    "The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD. Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average.": [

Addressing in the analysis:\n   - **Difference 1 (Verb Choice)**: Implicitly addressed in the context of \"putting people on pedestals,\" but not explicitly mentioned which verb conveys which nuance.\n   - **Difference 2 (Noun Form)**: Not explicitly addressed in the analysis; the analysis discusses idiomatic expressions but does not specify singular vs. plural implications.\n   - **Difference 3 (Register and Style)**: Not explicitly addressed; the analysis mentions the impact of the phrases but does not differentiate between \"stellen\" and \"setzen.\"\n   - **Difference 4 (Implicit Nuance of Pedestal)**: The analysis briefly touches on the idiomatic nature of \"putting someone on a pedestal,\" but does not focus on singular vs. plural.\n\n3.
