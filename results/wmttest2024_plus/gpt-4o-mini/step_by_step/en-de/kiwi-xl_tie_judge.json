Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now let's continue. We've all done something self-destructive at some point in our lives. Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can eventually arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual. So, here are seven common behaviors of a self-destructive person.": [
