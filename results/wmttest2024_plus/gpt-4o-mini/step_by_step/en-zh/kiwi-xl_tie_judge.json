This changes the nuance from discussing specific issues to a broader context.\n      \n   2. **Use of \"前任和开创性的部长\" vs. \"前任、开创性的部长\"**\n      - Translation-1 has \"前任和开创性的部长\" which translates to \"the predecessor and pioneering minister\".

The first phrase indicates placement (it’s here), while the second suggests existence (there is one here).\n\n   6. **Wording for \"alarm system installed\"**:\n      - Translation-1 states \"报警系统也安装好了\" (bàojǐng xìtǒng yě ānzhuāng hǎole), while Translation-2 uses \"还安装了报警系统\" (hái ānzhuāngle bàojǐng xìtǒng).

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.

Local bosses are already fretting about a German version of the gilets jaunes protests in France in 2018, which culminated in yellow-jacketed demonstrators torching cars on the Champs-Elysées and the police stepping in with tear gas. Jochen Kopelke, head of Germany's police union, warned in an interview with Tagesspiegel, a daily, that the farmers were probably \"just the start of an enormous wave of protest this year.\" Germany was the only big economy to shrink in 2023, and the year ended on an especially sour note, with an unexpected drop in business confidence in December.
