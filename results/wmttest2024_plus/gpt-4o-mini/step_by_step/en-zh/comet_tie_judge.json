The former focuses on \"grand ambitions\", whereas the latter emphasizes \"ambition and aspirations\".\n   \n   2. **Translation of \"devolved\"**: Translation-1 uses \"下放\", while Translation-2 employs \"分权\". Both terms refer to the transfer of authority; however, \"分权\" often implies a broader context of power distribution, while \"下放\" can be more focused on delegating authority.\n   \n   3. **Translation of \"aggregates tax\"**: Both translations retain \"集料税\", indicating a direct translation; hence, there's no significant change here.\n   \n   4. **Wording of \"virgin products\"**: Translation-1 translates this as \"原材料\", indicating \"raw materials,\" while Translation-2 uses \"原始产品\", translating it to \"original products\". This reflects a slight variation in the choice of terminology.\n   \n   5. **Phrasing of “shift away from”**: Translation-1 uses \"加速减少对原材料的使用\", which means \"accelerate the reduction of the use of raw materials\", while Translation-2 phrases it as \"加速减少对原始产品使用的转变\", translating to \"accelerate the change to reduce the use of original products\". The difference is in the focus on the process vs. the outcome.\n\n2.

    "About 450 million years ago, plants took a giant leap out of the oceans onto the land to become the plants that we know and love today. But how did they survive? Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?": [

Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well.

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months.

The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market.

    "Welcome to Cosa, in Italy. Cosa is believed to be an ancient Roman settlement. The site was excavated at least four times over the last century. What is there to excavate if Cosa is originally a Roman site? Was the Pantheon in Rome excavated? No, the Pantheon is even at the same ground level as the surrounding, contemporary buildings. And why is that? Because the Pantheon was probably built during the Roman era. It is also almost cardinally oriented, which indicates that it cannot be very ancient.": [
