It corresponds to the part of the analysis that suggests using \"остро раскритиковали\" or \"сильно осудили\" for greater intensity.\n   2. **Word Order**: This specific aspect of word order is not explicitly addressed in the analysis. The analysis focuses on the translations and meanings rather than the syntax.\n   3. **Intention of Criticism**: The emphasis on intensity via \"резко\" is implicitly part of the analysis, as the analysis notes the importance of conveying the intensity of \"blasted,\" which suggests a need for a nuanced expression in the Russian translation.\n\n3. **Count of Reflections in Analysis**:\n   - Differences related to Translation-1 (1 and 2): 1 (only the first difference about intensity is reflected).\n   - Differences related to Translation-2 (1 and 3): 2 (both the emphasis from \"резко\" and intensity in general are reflected).\n\n<trans-1-cnt>1</trans-1-cnt>\n<trans-2-cnt>2</trans-2-cnt>"

It was a “minor” neurosurgery giving my brain more room from a condition I was born with that became symptomatic after having kids (chiari malformation). The moment I woke up has stuck with me, so I relive it a bit when I watch medical shows particularly with a neurosurgeon 😂. Hospital playlist has been on my list for a long time, and I’m really enjoying it right now. #kdrama": [

The first emphasizes the surgery having general anesthesia, while the second focuses on the need for general anesthesia.\n   2. **Phrase structure for \"giving my brain more room\"**: Translation-1 uses \"из-за которой моему мозгу стало больше места\", whereas Translation-2 uses \"в ходе которой я стал давать своему мозгу больше места\". The former is more straightforward, while the latter makes it sound as though the action was intentional by the speaker.\n   3. **Waking Up Reference**: Translation-1 uses \"проснулся\" (masculine, indicating a male speaker), while Translation-2 uses \"проснулась\" (feminine, indicating a female speaker). This indicates a difference in the implied gender of the subject.\n   4. **Time reference for the “hospital playlist”**: Translation-1 states \"давно в моем списке\" while Translation-2 states \"уже давно в моем списке\". The latter emphasizes the time aspect a bit more.\n   5. **Emotional emphasis**: Translation-1 uses \"мне очень нравится его смотреть сейчас\", while Translation-2 uses \"мне сейчас действительно нравится его смотреть\".

Translation-1 states \"но не неожиданным,\" while Translation-2 uses \"но не удивителен.\" The words \"неожиданным\" and \"не удивителен\" convey similar meanings but have different connotations in their context.\n   3. In Translation-1, \"Бумаги были повсюду\" is used, while Translation-2 uses \"Бумаги лежали повсюду,\" adding the verb \"лежали\" which gives a slightly different action perspective.\n   4. Translation-1 says \"повсюду лежали ледяные скульптуры,\" while Translation-2 translates this as \"а вокруг валялись несколько ледяных скульптур.\" The phrase \"валялись\" suggests more disorganization than \"лежали,\" and the former includes \"несколько,\" changing the quantity's nuance.\n   5. Translation-1 states \"света было очень мало,\" while Translation-2 uses \"и света было мало или совсем не было.\" The latter offers a more nuanced description of the light situation.\n   6.

    "Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved. Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis. Anything else is simply not going to work.": [

This change alters the modality from a possibility to a certainty.\n   2. **\"возврату к нормальному состоянию\" vs. \"возврату к норме\"** - Translation-1 translates \"return to normal\" as \"возврат к нормальному состоянию\" (return to a normal state), while Translation-2 simplifies it to \"возврат к норме\" (return to norm), which is more idiomatic.\n   3. **\"вводить внешние контрольные механизмы\" vs. \"накладывать внешние ограничения\"** - Translation-1 uses \"накладывать внешние ограничения\" (impose external restrictions), while Translation-2 uses \"вводить внешние контрольные механизмы\" (introduce external control mechanisms).
