Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?": [

The word choice for Facebook is explicitly addressed in the analysis when discussing \"quit FB.\" It suggests that \"удалить аккаунт\" (delete account) is more common, but acknowledges that \"ушел\" (left) could work informally.\n   2.

The analysis notes that \"killed\" in the original text is better translated as \"удалил\" or \"деактивировал\" (deleted or deactivated), though it doesn't specifically mention \"закрыл.\"\n   3.

Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now let's continue. We've all done something self-destructive at some point in our lives. Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can eventually arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual. So, here are seven common behaviors of a self-destructive person.": [
