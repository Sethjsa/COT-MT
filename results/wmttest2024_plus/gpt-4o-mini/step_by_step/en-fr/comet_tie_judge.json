Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?": [

Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone. Now let's continue. We've all done something self-destructive at some point in our lives. Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally.

This reflects a subtle difference in tone, implying that while there is a flaw noted, the positive aspect is more strongly highlighted in Translation-1.\n   3. **Stylistic Preference** - The choice of \"tout de même\" in Translation-1 may feel more idiomatic and conversational in French compared to the slightly more formal \"malgré tout\" in Translation-2.\n\n2. **Addressed in the Analysis:**\n   1.

    "Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved. Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis. Anything else is simply not going to work.": [
