In Translation-2, \"jdeme na ženy v hokeji Badgers!\" translates to \"we're going for the women in hockey Badgers!\", which feels more like an invitation or declaration to attend a game rather than a demonstration of enthusiasm.\n   2. The use of \"hurá\" (hooray) in Translation-1 conveys excitement, whereas \"jdeme na\" (we're going to) in Translation-2 suggests a more neutral or less enthusiastic tone.\n   3. The structure of Translation-1 feels more like a rallying cry, while Translation-2 has a more straightforward informational tone.\n\n2. **Reflection in Analysis:**\n   1. The idea of conveying enthusiasm is explicitly mentioned in the analysis when discussing \"go Badgers Women’s hockey!\" and the need to reflect excitement (point 2 in the Analysis). Therefore, this difference is reflected.\n   2. The difference in tone and style between \"hurá\" and \"jdeme na\" is implicitly addressed in the analysis where it discusses maintaining an informal tone and capturing the excitement of sports audiences. However, it does not specify the exact phrases used, so it is not explicitly covered. Thus, this difference is somewhat reflected, but could be clearer.\n   3. The distinct structural difference in how the cheer is expressed in both translations wasn't explicitly referenced in the analysis.

He shoulded his rifle and put his helmet on a small hook connected to his belt. It had all its fixing, respirator, goggles, everything needed.

Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil-dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reach deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants.

The analysis discusses the translation of \"Eastercon\" as needing to convey that it is a science fiction convention and suggests \"velikonoční con.\"\n   \n2. **Cultural Context**:\n   - **Addressed:** Yes. The analysis mentions that Czech audiences might not be familiar with the convention and should have it described.\n\n3. **Language Consistency**:\n   - **Addressed:** Implicitly. The analysis suggests that \"a literal translation might not convey the cultural context effectively,\" implying that consistency in language may provide clearer communication.\n\n4. **Semantics**:\n   - **Addressed:** Yes. The analysis suggests adding context to \"Eastercon\" if not translating it, implying a need for clarity in semantical meaning.\n\n### Counts\n\n- Differences related to Translation-1 reflected in the analysis: 3 \n- Differences related to Translation-2 reflected in the analysis: 1 \n\n<trans-1-cnt>3</trans-1-cnt> \n<trans-2-cnt>1</trans-2-cnt>"

    "At the precinct level, we just need to look at the Sydney CBD as an example of an area which has grown from its pre-settlement landscape into a two-storey city, from a maximum height of 150 feet to the soaring towers of today. At a much scaled-down level, the same can occur across Sydney's town centres located around transport nodes. Inner suburbs must also evolve, with a swing to more affordable apartment living at heights below the tree tops on key sites. Of course, the new growth in housing needs to be well-designed and trees, landscaping and parks need to be included along with other essential infrastructure.": [

Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can eventually arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual.

Translation-2 (\"počkáme a uvidíme\") is in the future tense indicating a decision to wait will happen later.\n   3. **Formality and Usage**: Translation-1 can be perceived as slightly more casual or conversational. Translation-2 may imply a firmer commitment to the action of waiting because it expresses a future plan.\n\n2.

    "Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector. A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.
