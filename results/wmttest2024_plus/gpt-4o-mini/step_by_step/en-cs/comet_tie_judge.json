Main Differences:\n   1. **\"popsalo\" vs. \"popisuje\"**: Translation-1 uses \"popsalo,\" which is past tense, while Translation-2 uses \"popisuje,\" which is present tense.\n   2. **\"svobodu poskytnutou\" vs. \"svobodu udělenou\"**: Translation-1 has \"svobodu poskytnutou\" while Translation-2 uses \"svobodu udělenou.\" This changes the nuance from \"granted\" to \"awarded.\"\n   3. **\"Buhariho\" vs. \"Buhara\"**: Translation-1 uses \"Buhariho\" (genitive form), while Translation-2 uses \"Buhara\" (nominative form).\n   4. **\"El-Rufaie\" vs. \"El-Rufaiho\"**: Translation-1 uses \"El-Rufaie,\" and Translation-2 uses \"El-Rufaiho,\" differing in the ending.\n   5. **\"ospravedlnilo\" vs. \"očistilo\"**: Translation-1 uses \"ospravedlnilo,\" meaning \"vindicated,\" while Translation-2 uses \"očistilo,\" meaning \"cleared\" or \"absolved.\"\n   6. **\"Dobrý den\" vs. \"Ahoj\"**: Translation-1 uses \"Dobrý den\" (formal), while Translation-2 uses \"Ahoj\" (informal).\n   7. **\"příhlaste se\" vs. \"odebírej\"**: Translation-1 uses \"příhlaste se\" (formal) while Translation-2 uses \"odebírej\" (subscribe in a less formal manner).\n   8. **\"kliknout na tlačítko oznámení\" vs. \"stisknout tlačítko pro upozornění\"**: Translation-2 uses \"kliknout na tlačítko oznámení,\" while Translation-1 uses \"stisknout tlačítko pro upozornění.\" This affects the verb usage.\n   9. **\"nových aktualitách\" vs. \"nové zprávy\"**: Translation-1 uses \"nových aktualitách,\" which is more nuanced, while Translation-2 states \"nové aktualizace zpráv\" which simplifies the phrase.\n\n2. Addressed in the Analysis:\n   1. Differentiated verb tense \"popsalo\" vs. \"popisuje\": Not explicitly addressed.\n   2. \"svobodu poskytnutou\" vs. \"svobodu udělenou\": The analysis mentions \"freedom granted\" which relates to both translations but doesn't specify this distinction.\n   3. \"Buhariho\" vs. \"Buhara\": Not addressed.\n   4. \"El-Rufaie\" vs. \"El-Rufaiho\": Not addressed.\n   5. \"ospravedlnilo\" vs. \"očistilo\": The analysis discusses \"vindicated\" but does not mention the specific word choices used in translations.\n   6. \"Dobrý den\" vs. \"Ahoj\": Not addressed.\n   7. \"příhlaste se\" vs. \"odebírej\": Not explicitly addressed.\n   8. \"kliknout na tlačítko oznámení\" vs. \"stisknout tlačítko pro upozornění\": The analysis mentions a preference for a more fluid phrase which correlates but does not specific this distinction.\n   9. \"nových aktualitách\" vs. \"nové zprávy\": The analysis addresses \"fresh news updates\" but does not elaborate on specific phrasing variations used.\n\n3. Number of differences reflected in the analysis:\n   - For Translation-1: 1 (the discussion about \"freedom granted\").\n   - For Translation-2: 0.\n\n<trans-1-cnt>1</trans-1-cnt>\n<trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"

    "Success! Last thing remaining is bolting the seat back.": [
        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Structure of \"last thing remaining\"**: \n      - Translation-1 uses \"Poslední věc, co zbývá\" (The last thing that remains), while Translation-2 uses \"Poslední věcí, kterou zbývá udělat\" (The last thing that needs to be done).\n   2. **Verb choice for securing the seat back**: \n      - Translation-1 uses \"připevnit\" (to fasten), while Translation-2 uses \"upevnit\" (to secure).\n   3. **Tone and formality**: \n      - Translation-1 is slightly more informal with \"co zbývá\" compared to Translation-2's \"kterou zbývá udělat,\" which is more formal and complete.\n   4. **Word count and complexity**: \n      - Translation-1 is shorter and more direct, while Translation-2 contains more words and adds complexity with the structure \"zbývá udělat.\"\n\n2. **Addressed in the Analysis:**\n   1. **Difference 1**: Addressed implicitly - The analysis discusses natural phrasing (\"Poslední věc, co je potřeba udělat\") but does not explicitly compare the syntactical structures of the two translations.\n   2. **Difference 2**: Addressed explicitly - The analysis mentions the meaning of \"bolting\" and provides \"připevnit\" as a suitable translation, but does not elaborate on “upevnit.”\n   3. **Difference 3**: Addressed implicitly - The analysis emphasizes using colloquialisms and natural expressions, hinting at tone without specifically mentioning the difference.\n   4. **Difference 4**: Not explicitly addressed - The analysis does not cover word count or the complexity of the sentence structure.\n\n3. **Counts of differences reflected in the analysis:**\n   - **Translation-1 related differences**: 2 reflected (1 and 3)\n   - **Translation-2 related differences**: 1 reflected (2)\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt>  \n<trans-2-cnt>1</trans-2-cnt>"
