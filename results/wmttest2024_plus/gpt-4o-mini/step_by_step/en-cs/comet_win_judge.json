Main Differences:\n   1. **Introduction Phrase**: Translation-1 uses \"Hey\" while Translation-2 uses \"Ahoj.\" Although both serve as informal greetings, \"Ahoj\" is a direct Czech translation of \"Hey.\"\n   2. **Addressing the Name**: Translation-1 uses \"Tenuk,\" while Translation-2 uses \"Tenuku,\" which is the accusative form of the name in Czech and makes it grammatically correct in this context.\n   3. **Polite Request Phrase**: Translation-1 has \"nemáš něco proti tomu,\" while Translation-2 phrases it as \"nevadilo by ti.\" The first emphasizes opposition (do you have anything against), and the second constructs a more straightforward request (would it bother you).\n   4. **Verb Form**: Translation-1 uses \"proměníš\" (you transform) while Translation-2 uses \"proměnit se\" (to transform). This difference alters the sentence structure and perspective slightly but preserves overall meaning.\n   5. **Modal Language**: In Translation-1, the additional phrase “když se” (=when you) is included, whereas Translation-2 does not contain this element and focuses purely on the action of transforming.\n\n2.

Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit. Self-destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally. It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Problems can eventually arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual.

The distinction is subtle but involves the preposition \"v\" (in) in Translation-2.\n   3. **Noun Usage**: Translation-1 uses \"motorky\" (motorcycle) whereas Translation-2 uses \"motocyklu\" (motorcycle). \"Motocyklu\" is a more formal term for motorcycle.\n   4. **Phrasing of altitude**: Translation-1 says \"ve výšce 4000 stop nad zemí\" (at the height of 4000 feet above the ground), which is slightly more descriptive than Translation-2's \"ve výšce 4000 stop\" (at the height of 4000 feet).\n   5. **Comma Placement**: Translation-1 has a comma before \"že je to kombinace\", while Translation-2 does not have this comma.

Addressing of differences in the Analysis:\n   1. **Wording Change**: Not explicitly addressed in the Analysis, though \"landed an airplane\" being directly translated is noted.\n   2. **Syntax**: The Analysis discusses careful attention in translating action verbs and implies a preference for direct translations but does not explicitly point out this structural change.\n   3. **Semantic Implication**: The Analysis emphasizes conveying the independence and accomplishment, reflecting the concern over the prepositional difference, though not explicitly mentioning the implications of \"s\" (with).\n   4. **Emphasis on Accomplishment**: This is explicitly addressed in the Analysis, particularly the focus on \"all by herself\" and the translation options provided (“úplně sama” or “jenom ona”).\n\n3.

Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well.

The wording is slightly different, with the latter being more direct.\n\n   2. **\"týkajících se osob mluvících rusky\" vs. \"na osobu hovořící rusky\"**:\n      - Translation-1 uses \"týkajících se osob mluvících rusky\" (regarding persons speaking in Russian), while Translation-2 simplifies it to \"na osobu hovořící rusky\" (against a person speaking in Russian). The former has a broader connotation, while the latter is more specific.\n\n   3. **\"v rámci snahy\" vs. \"v snaze\"**:\n      - Translation-1 uses \"v rámci snahy\" (in the framework of an effort), whereas Translation-2 uses \"v snaze\" (in an effort). The first phrase has a more formal connotation compared to the simpler second phrase.\n\n   4. **Use of \"v rámci snahy\" compared to \"v snaze\"**:\n      - As noted above, the syntactical structure is different, which slightly affects the formality of the phrase.\n\n   5. **Punctuation and placement of \"údajně\"**:\n      - The placement of \"údajně\" (allegedly) is consistent in both translations, but the use of quotation marks in Translation-1 for 'ochránit' implies more irony than in Translation-2.\n\n2. Addressing the analysis:\n\n   1. The difference regarding \"stížností na úřady\" vs. \"stížností úřadům\" is not explicitly addressed, but the overall concern with the connotation of reporting to authorities is implicitly touched upon, particularly in point 1 of the Analysis.\n   \n   2. The difference regarding \"týkajících se osob mluvících rusky\" vs. \"na osobu hovořící rusky\" is not explicitly addressed in the Analysis, although the mention of cultural connotations around \"speaking in Russian\" relates to this difference in a broad sense (point 2).\n   \n   3. The difference of \"v rámci snahy\" vs. \"v snaze\" is not explicitly addressed in the Analysis, as it does not cover the nuances of phrasing or formality in this context.\n   \n   4. The difference regarding punctuation and placement of \"údajně\" is not discussed in the Analysis; thus no connection is made to this point regarding skepticism or irony (point 3).\n\n3.

So what I'm going to do first for the spine repair is I need to remove this old spine. So, hopefully I can save this label and I can reattach it to the new material that we put over the spine. That way I don't have to worry about creating a paper label or going without a label. So I'll cut this part off first and I'll show you how to clean that up later.": [

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.

The difference in **wording of the greeting** (Point 1) is implicitly addressed in the Analysis, where it mentions that \"Ráno všem\" is not effective, favoring \"Dobré ráno, všichni\" or \"Ahoj všichni.\" \n\n2. The difference in **punctuation** (Point 2) is not addressed in the Analysis, indicating that punctuation choices were not part of the considerations. \n\n3. The difference in **formality and tone** (Point 3) is implicitly addressed. The Analysis discusses the need for a casual and friendly greeting, which aligns more closely with the tone of \"Ahoj všichni\" but also implies a preference for \"Dobré ráno, všichni\" over \"Dobré ráno všem\" based on tone.\n\n### Counts of Reflected Differences\n- Differences related to Translation-1 (wording and tone) are reflected in the Analysis: **2**\n- Differences related to Translation-2 (punctuation) are not reflected in the Analysis: **0** \n\nOutput:\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt> \n<trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"
