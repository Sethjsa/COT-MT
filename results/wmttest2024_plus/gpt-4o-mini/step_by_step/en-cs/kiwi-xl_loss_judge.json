You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just E6000ed these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to.

The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years. It must be lonely in the great distant sky. Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living. Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat.

The differences in wording, syntax, and semantics between Translation-1 and Translation-2 are explicitly addressed in the Analysis. The analysis focuses on capturing the essence of the request which emphasizes \"Zaměstnej mě!\" as the fitting direct translation, indicating the importance of a direct and imperative tone.\n   2. The mention of idiomatic expressions and the need for an appropriate tone is also covered when discussing the conversational context and nuances. The use of direct commands is articulated in the conclusion highlighting \"Zaměstnej mě!\".\n\n3. **Count of reflected differences**:\n   - For Translation-1: All relevant differences are reflected in the analysis (4 out of 4).\n   - For Translation-2: None of the differences are directly reflected in the analysis (0 out of 4).\n\n<trans-1-cnt>4</trans-1-cnt> and <trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"

    "“Looks like capture” Cohren guessed as the two Sentinels disappeared into the cloud of ash and smoke. Shouting and gunshots echoed from the ridge, but quickly ceased.

        "1. **Main Differences:**\n   1. **Wording:** Translation-1 uses the phrase \"pokud nám první týden nového roku nepůjde\" (if the first week of the new year doesn’t go well), while Translation-2 uses \"Oslavme první týden nového roku\" (Let's celebrate the first week of the new year). The former implies a negative outcome, while the latter suggests a positive one.\n   2. **Syntax:** Translation-1 is conditional and informal, indicating a scenario of failure, whereas Translation-2 is imperative, suggesting an action to be taken—celebrating.\n   3. **Semantics:** The meaning in Translation-1 revolves around a potential failure or disappointment, while Translation-2 completely shifts the focus toward positivity and celebration.\n   4. **Style:** Translation-1 carries a more casual and reflective tone (considering the success or failure of the week), while Translation-2 is more festive and proactive in nature, suggesting a celebration.\n\n2. **Analysis Reference:**\n   1. **Explicitly Addressed:** The idiomatic nature of \"let's tank\" is addressed in the analysis, particularly regarding its meaning of doing poorly, which relates to Translation-1.

Reference: \"A more appropriate phrase could be 'pokud se nám první týden nového roku nepovede.'\"\n   \n   3. **Not Addressed:** Translation-2 is not explicitly mentioned in the analysis, as it suggests a significantly different meaning (celebration) that is contrary to the original text's implication of failing.\n\n   4. **Not Addressed:** Translation-2's positive framing is not reflected in the analysis since the focus is primarily on how to convey the failed aspect of the original text.\n\n3. **Count of Differences Reflected:**\n   - **Translation-1:** 2 differences reflected in the analysis (wording and semantics).\n   - **Translation-2:** 0 differences reflected in the analysis.\n\n<trans-1-cnt>2</trans-1-cnt> and <trans-2-cnt>0</trans-2-cnt>"
